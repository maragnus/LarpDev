# Mystwood Chapter: Burgundar

Here are written the words of the so-called ‘Voiceless Monk’, said to dwell in the cave monastery of St. Lonzagen in
Burgundy.

"The history of the land called Burgundar is long, and old, and cold. In times before history, it was a home to the Fae,
and then the great Empire of the Romans spread across the face of the earth, battling the Chaos-loving Saxons and
driving back the darkness for a time. Not far to the north of the tract called Burgundar was the outermost limit of the
Empire, the city of Aquila, a new capital to rival Ravenna in luxury, Rome in wealth, and Byzantium in knowledge."
"Alas, all know how the tale of Rome ended. The Dragon took wing, and Rome's outposts, and her legions, burned to
ash."

"Time passed, and the great king Carolus Magnus, who folk also call Charles the Great or Charlemagne, spread his
hand across the lands of the west. No longer was Chaos to be found in the lands of men, and the faith of the Holy
Three spread by the deeds of the Ordo Palatine (the Knights Paladin) and the words of the humble priests. In
Venezia, Carolus Magnus was crowned Emperor of the Faithful, and his people, the Navarii , grew prosperous and
wealthy."

"Alas, all know how the tale of the Holy Empire ended. Men die, and so do their kingdoms, broken by law and the
sword. Here rose Germania, and Pelancia, Navarre and Burgundy."

"Long years passed, and the Kings of Burgundy warred with the great League of Cities founded after the fall of the
Teutons to Chaos. In the 604th year After Unification, Skandians (of the folk of Kven) from the distant north, lured
with promises of fairy-gold and land, sailed down the river Elwash, and travelled overland to settle in the broken hills
of Burgundar. There, they were to form a buffer against the hostilities of their cousins, the city states called The
League. There, they brought their Northern gods, who were not to last long in the heart, and soon enough were
simple faces ascribed to the Three. There, they brought the tongue of Skandia, consigned now to history, except in
names and songs. There, they brought the Old Ways of the Jarls, and Weregild, and Holmgang, only to find bonds of
kinship and trust overshadowed by paper deeds and the works of hollow men."

"And there, my people dwell to this day, surrounded by people who are not their foes, but neither are they friends.
Soft people who do not know the way of axe and rune. But they will not be soft forever. Burgundar is an anvil, the
anvil the Romans were forged on, the anvil Charlemagne was forged on, and the anvil Chaos was broken on when the
children of Navarre fled beyond their forests."

"The folk of Burgundar, the blood descendants of Jarl Askel Oxensteina of the Kvenner, are a hammer, the hammer
of Thunderer, who some call Mercy. And visitor, we will see you strong, or see you shattered.”

## HISTORY

Centuries ago, there was a Roman village called Aurelos on the site of what is now Burgundar. Over time, it grew into
a town, serving a monastery of the Church called Harrow. When Harrow fell to heresy and burned in the 6th century,
the land was barren and uninhabited for centuries, until Skandian people, fleeing their northern homelands following
war and famine, settled the ruins and named their new village Burgundar.

The old stories passed down by the skalds say that the lands were offered to them by the King of Pelancia, long
before he bent the knee to the throne of Navarre. The Skandian refugees in return swore to protect the area from the
forces of both Chaos and the city-states of the League that ever threatened the borderlands. The Skandians cut out
their village in the depths of the forest not far from the ruins of Harrow, not far from the Road that to this day runs
true from east to west.. In the center of their new village they planted the sapling Spaðomur, or Spaatlemoore, an
offshoot of the world-tree Yggdrasil, which was their greatest treasure.

While they set about the day to day business of living and surviving, the larger politics of nations moved on. The
Kingdom of Pelancia found itself hemmed in and its power waning until the line of the Pelancian Kings, the
Rochvalls, were forced to bend the knee and swear fealty to the Kingdom of Navarre. The Kingdom of Burgundy to
the south took this opportunity to expand their borders northward, beyond the Grey Mountains and laid claim to
both Land’s End and the southern Mystwood.

By the year 900, the original Skandian refugees had established a small, but
prospering village that had blended the cultures of Skandia, Navarre, and
Burgundy. Around the year 910 hordes of Chaos under the Knights
Teutonic swept across the League, pillaging and burning. While the
baronies of Luceval and Cairnwood that made up the northern Mystwood
fell and were largely deserted, the southern Mystwood fared slightly better.
Bolstered by the blessings of Spaatlemoore, the worst of the forces of
Chaos were repulsed,, but not without losses. The villagers of Burgundar
lost much of their culture, turning to the faith of the Three. They rebuilt,
nearly returning to their former glory.

Alas, this good fortune was not to last forever. In 960 plague swept the land
and laid low many of the inhabitants. The plague was then followed by the
Great Fire which destroyed what little was left still standing of the village.
Although the precise reasons are still a matter of gossip, in 963 the King of
Burgundy gifted the county of Burgundar to Duke Guilford II, Duke of the
Eastmarch of Navarre. As the land was largely deserted, the Duke set about
resettling the County. To this end he installed the Count and Countess
Renaud to oversee the settlement of his newly acquired land.
One of the Count’s first orders of business was brokering an agreement
with the local Jarls. Despite the hardships that had beset the lands, they still
retained significant sway over the people that remained and would not
simply lay aside their traditional rights and privileges that had been granted
generations past. An agreement was made that they would hold amongst
themselves a Thynge at regular intervals to determine who would be the Jarl
of Jarls, first among equals, and the representative of their people to the
Count and Countess. The first Thynge was a contest between the two most
powerful Jarls at the time: Jarl Osborn, descendant of Askel the first Jarl of
Burgunder, and Jarl Godrick of the line of Voldemar, a line of sorcerers
that also partially traced its origin back to the founding of the original
settlement. Jarl Godrick was the victor, and assumed the position of advisor
and representative to the Count and Countess.

In 967 it was discovered that Jarl Godrick and the Countess Renaud had conspired together to murder the Count
Renaud by use of necromancy and were further beginning to spread their evil through the county. An alliance was
formed of several disparate factions. The peoples of the village of Burgundar and Stonewick. Several local Jarls.
Erudites, a man who claimed to have been a governor of Aquila from before the fall of Rome. These diverse forces
joined together in rebellion, and ultimately slew both Jarl Godrick and the Countess Renaud.

The fallout of this action was swift. King Stephen himself dispatched a cadre of his personal knights to the village to
apprehend and bring to trial the leaders of the rebellion. While sufficient proof of the necessity of immediate action in
defense of life was presented, such that the leaders of the revolt were not executed, several were still branded for
treason against the Crown.
In 968, Duke Guilford II of the Eastmarch died without declaring an heir. The ensuing civil war between his stepdaughter Lady Genevieve, his cousin John Westmore, and Baroness Orla of Fenwyck brought battle and bloodshed
once more to Burgundar. After the defeat and death of Baroness Orla by the forces of Lady Genevieve, Lady
Genevieve offered terms of peace to John Westmore, which he accepted. Lady Genevieve was named Duchess of the
Eastmarch while the counties of Burgundar, Drakewood, Elwash, and Luceval were formed into the March of
Luceval and placed under the rule of now Margrave John Westmore.

## GEOGRAPHY AND COUNTIES OF LUCEVAL

The March of Luceval covers the southern half of the Mystwood Forest. It extends from the River Elwash in the east
to the Tower Hills in the west. Southward is the Kingdom of Burgundy. To the north lies the northern stretches of
the Mystwood Forest which is held directly by the Duchy of Eastmarch. The March is further divided into four
Counties: Drakewood to the north, Burgundar to the east, Elwash to the south, and Luceval to the west.

### County Burgundar
Of the four counties that make up the March of Luceval, County Burgundar is the most settled and populated. It’s
largest settlement is a market village of the same name, followed closely by the mining village of Stonewick. Other
than these two villages most settlements are small farming communities, many without proper names. However, with
the blessing of the Margrave, the population has begun to swell and new homesteads and crofts are being established
at a remarkable rate. This is primarily due to the market village of Burgundar which is the chief settlement of the
County and the largest center of trade in all of the March.

The next largest village is the mining settlement of Stonewick which lies further to the south. Count Erudites and
Countess Floras reside at the Renaud Manor, a semi-fortified mansion surrounded by farms and a few families of
crafters that provide services to the manor. Their colors are red and white.

The people who call county Burgundar home are of a mixed lot. Many can trace their ancestry to either the Kingdom
of Burgundy to the south while others still recall the stories of the Great Migration that their Skandian ancestors
endured generations ago. Most peculiar, perhaps, are those that show some distant kinship to the Duergar, Elves,
Shapechangers, and the like that old stories say were once common in the forests and hills of Burgundar. While such
ancestries are certainly known throughout the larger world, they are a bit more common in County Burgundar and the
surrounding areas.

Count Erudites and Countess Floras reside at the Renaud Manor, a semi-fortified mansion surrounded by farms and a
few families of crafters that provide services to the manor. Their colors are red and white.

### County Elwash

County Elwash is even more sparsely populated than County Burgundar due largely to its proximity to Mount Draca.
Few yet hardy are the folk who dare eke out an existence in the shadow of that dread place. The mountain is home to
tribes of goblins and orcs who often raid the surrounding area from their caves and delves. Count Theo Renaud,
newly come to his majority, governs from Briarwell, a small but heavily fortified stone motte and bailey castle, that has
often been a last refuge for the nearby peasantry when raiding warbands have descended from the mountain. His
colors are orange and white.

### County Drakewood

County Drakewood takes its name from the broods of drakes that make their nests in the marshes and swamps deep
within the forest. It is only by the continual effort of the locals that the main road is kept passable, else the swamp
would have reclaimed it years ago. Indeed, travelers through the Drakewood are warned to keep to the main roads as
navigating the marshes is often dangerous. However, that same difficulty in traversing the area has been a boon to the
smugglers and thieves who are rumored to have many hideouts secreted away from the eyes of the guard. The rarely
seen Countess Allard oversees the affairs of the county from her holdings of Caer Balcard. Her colors are purple and
green.

### County Luceval

County Luceval is the newly chosen seat of Margrave Westmore. Much of the land was decimated when the hordes of
Chaos swept through in 910 and remains abandoned. However, the Margrave has begun the work to rebuild the
ruined castle of Caer Luceval to its former glory. Already many builders and crafters have begun to move to the
county. It is rumored that the Margrave plans to build a guildhall for the Guild of Guilds, and a grand marketplace
once the work on Caer Luceval is complete. His colors are blue and gray.
Other places of note within the March include an abbey currently being constructed under the auspices of the
Bishopric of St. Aachen, and the ruins of Harrow. Since the fall of Harrow to heresy and fire, no permanent Abby has
been built within the March. The faithful of the new Abbey seek to remedy this.

## OTHER LOCAL AREAS

### Kriegsgrab

Kriegsgrab, also called the Dead Forest, is one of the smaller city states of the League, but as it lies so close to county
Burgundar there is much trade and movement between the two. During the earliest expansions of Rome, the Legion
suffered a massive defeat here at the hands of Germanic tribesmen who plagued the land. As Rome never took the
land, it became a haunt for necromancers and haruspices hoping to glean knowledge and power from the dead.
To this day, the forest still shows scars of the battle, and the existence of fell energy means and undead are a constant
danger. Some are simply lost souls, never properly put to rest. Others are the work of cults of necromancers that still
lurk within the forest. Many still wear the tattered remains of Roman armor.

The people who call Kriegsgrab their home tend to be grim and superstitious, a side effect of living in a land so
infested with constant reminders of death. Faith in the Wild is very common.

Gravesend, the ancient seat of the Prince of Kreigsgrab, has lain deserted for the better part of two generations. The
direct line of this Prince is said to have died out some 300 years ago. While many have tried to claim lordship over
Kreigsgrab over the years, all who have attempted to claim the Ebon Throne in the heart of the ruined castle have
died under mysterious circumstances within a year of making their claim. Whispers of a curse laid by the last prince
surround the hall, as does a prophecy that the curse may someday be lifted by a true heir. Although there is no Prince,
the villages of the city-state continue to be governed by a Prince’s Council. The colors of the Council are gold and
black.

### Land’s End

Lying to the south of the March of Luceval, just over the border in the Kingdom of Burgundy are the rolling foothills
and deep forests of Land’s End. Here, the hills meet the Grey Mountains that divide southern Navarre from northern
Burgundy. These high and often impassable peaks effectively cut Land’s End off from Burgundy, save for journeying
eastward through Kriegsgrab and the League, or westward through Pelancia to Shandlin’s Ferry, before turning south
into the valleys of the barony. Prior to Burgundy gifting the lands that now form the County of Burgundar to the late
Duke Guilford II, this was of little consequence. However, with the formation of the March of Luceval, Land’s End
finds itself receiving more notice from Margrave Westmore than its own lord, who resides south of the mountains.
Land’s End is primarily known for its excellent wool and many who reside there make their living from the wool
trade, whether that be as shepherds, tailors, or merchants. However, this wealth has made the villages of Land’s End a
common target for raids by brigands and Skandian Jarls. As a result, skilled mercenaries and bodyguards can often
find lucrative work.

Beyond the villages and the wool trade are the untamed forests that cover much of the mountain range. Hunters,
foresters, and poachers alike all make a living from the bounty of the primal forests. However, stories swirl that the
deep woods are home to clans of shifters, more animal than human, who will strike down any who dare bring harm to
woodlands.

### Pelancia

To the west of the March lies the Barony of Pelancia. It has a mild climate and rich agricultural land with much trade
coming up the river Lucerin. It is ruled by the masked Baron Baldwin Rochvall and its colors are brown and blue.
The Rochvall seat of Tiras Ethanor lies nestled between the Grey Mountains and the edge of the Mystwood forest.
Said to have been built by the Fae, Tiras Ethanor is one of the great wonders of Navarre, it’s towers seeming too tall
and graceful to have been built without magic. Indeed, Fae blood is known to run in the veins of many who call
Pelancia home.

From Tiras Ethanor the River Lucerin flows to the village of Driftford or Driftfield, whose inhabitants are mostly
concerned with the floating of logs down river, the raising of sheep, and arguing over whether the proper name of the
village is Driftford or Driftfield. Further west lies Summermill, the summer home of the Rochvall line, and Shandlin’s
Ferry which prospers from trade with Burgundy the south.
When the March of Luceval was founded, Pelancia lost the County of Elwash from its own holdings, which many
consider a punishment from the Duchess for Baron Baldwin’s lack of participation in the Civil War.

## SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND LOCAL TRADITIONS

County Burgundar lies within the March of Luceval, that was formed in the aftermath of the civil war that followed
the death of Duke Guilford II. While part of the Kingdom of Navarre, and subject to the laws and traditions thereof,
Burgundar’s sizeable Skandian population, and its proximity to the Kingdom of Burgundy to the south, have resulted
in many of the traditions and laws of those peoples continuing to be observed.

The most notable tradition is the continued prominence and recognition of the local Jarls. Holding more authority
than a knight, but less than hereditary nobility, Jarls technically hold no noble title within Navarre. The late Count
Renaud agreed to recognize their traditional authority and rights provided they in turn agreed to cease raiding and
warring with any lands held by Navarre. The Jarls also agreed that they would regularly hold amongst themselves a
Thynge to determine who would be Jarl of Jarls and the representative of their people to the Count. The Margrave
Westmore has agreed to uphold this arrangement.

Jarls typically control relatively small areas that primarily consist of their household, the households of their Thanes
and Huscarls, and a small number of crafters. While in Navarran tradition a magistrate would handle any legal matters
and a local knight or guard contingent would handle any military matters, a Jarl is responsible for both aspects. They
are judge and warchief in one.

Each Jarl has at least one, if not several Thanes. These are the most trusted warriors of a Jarl’s retinue and serve as
both advisors in times of peace and war leaders in times of conflict. Thane is very rarely a hereditary title, but rather
one that is earned in service to a Jarl. Most Thanes were once Huscarls who earned their position through loyalty and
service on and off the battlefield.

In addition to Thanes, each Jarl’s household also includes a number of Huscarls. These are the sworn swords of the
Jarl who follow them wherever fortune and the tides of life may take them. Huscarl is never a hereditary title. It is one
that must be earned through loyalty and bloodshed.




## RELIGION

### CHURCH OF THE THREE

The dominant faith of the March is the Three, but few settlements are large enough to have a resident ordained priest
of each god. Most are instead visited semi-regularly by traveling friars, though some are home to a lay cleric who
attends to the day to day needs of the faithful.
The unsettled nature of the March has lent itself to the establishment of many circles of Wild followers, although
there are almost as many fellowships of Mercy worshippers. The worship of Justice, while not uncommon, is not quite
as prevalent. With the recent setting of the cornerstone for the new abbey, there has been an influx of pilgrims and at
least one Knight Penitent.

### THE OLD FAITH

When the Skandians migrated south from their cold northern lands they brought their gods with them. Many debate
the nature of the Northern gods. Some claim they are nought but fae, that delight in tricking mortals for their own
amusement. Others say they are daemons of Chaos that ever strive for the downfall of all that is good. Still others
believe they are the Three given names in the northern tongue as revealed to Skandians by saints of old. It is possible
that they are a mix of fae, daemons, the Three, and beings more strange.
Whatever the truth, worship of the Northern gods is often viewed with suspicion, if not open hostility and is illegal in
most parts of Navarre.

By Edict of Margrave Westmore, worship of the Northern gods by those of Skandian descent is legal within the
March of Luceval with several caveats. Firstly, worship of the Northern gods is permitted only to those of Skandian
descent. Secondly, worshippers are strictly forbidden from attempting to convert or otherwise preslatyzing their faith
to those not of Skandian blood. Thirdly, practitioners may in no way interfere with business of the Church of the Three.
The Skandian pantheon consists of twelve powers. Several of the powers are traditionally worshiped together upon a
single shrine. Unlike the Three, followers of the Skandian faith worship the full pantheon, rather than dedicating
themselves to one. While many favor one or two, they can, and do, offer prayers and seek blessings from any member
of the pantheon.

#### Wothir, One Eye, The Raven Father

“And it was then with his axe the fiendish Flokir, imbued with chaotic powers cut deep into Ragnvald’s shield. Yet Ragnvald held his shield firm, and
with unwavering spirit stood while his blood soaked the ground beneath his feet. It was then the raven landed upon Ragnvald’s shield, and Flokir
lamented before Wothir as Chaos, and his very life, drained away from his body. Ragnvald stood, and the chiefs knelt before their new High King, before
the Chosen of Wothir.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated during the Rite of Chiefs, Norroway
Wothir is the lord of all others in the Old Faith, and is worshiped by chiefs, wizards and the like for his wisdom and
even handed judgement. While Wothir rules from his throne in the Halls of Glory, he can often be found roaming the
many realms seeking knowledge and dispensing wisdom in equal measure. While other gods of the pantheon are more
eager to give their blessings, Wothir is quite picky with who he deems worthy. Most who do receive his blessings go
on to do great things, and tend to be great chieftains, legendary warriors and renowned wise folk. Ravens are believed
to be his messengers, and Wothir will himself from time to time take the form of a raven.

Symbols: Ravens, a single eye, a closed book

#### Thunderer, the Smith, The Protector

“Before them stood the hordes of Scythia, mighty and terrible in their machinations. And before the breaking shield wall of brave Skandians stood
Ulfrik the Unrelenting, whose body was a mix of blood and runes. His men breaking, Ulfrik charged forth alone against the unrelenting hordes of chaos,
and that was when they heard it. It was distant rumbling at first, but then it became a booming chorus as the storms swirled overhead. A crack of
thunder saw Ulfrik the Unrelenting remade into Ulfrik the Guardian, as wounds closed and armor forged upon his body. With a cry of praise to The
Thunderer Ulfrik laid low the creatures of chaos with his remaining shield brothers and sisters.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated during the Battle of Splintered Shields, Karelia.
The Thunderer is he who brings the storms, who helps light your hearth and heals your wounds. He is also seen as a
great protector of all mortalkind, giving his blessings to those who go to great lengths to protect their people in war or
sickness. His great hammer (insert name here) can be heard ringing out as thunder during the storm, where he forges
new weapons and armor as well as everyday items such as nails, farming tools and more. The Thunderer is worshiped
by warriors, blacksmiths, healers, herbalists and more.

Symbols: A hammer, an anvil, shields

#### The Choosers of the Slain and The Weavers of Fate, Valkyrie, Norn

“...and she threw herself to the earth, crying out to the very heavens for her son back. Cruel fate had taken him too early, too soon she said. She begged the
heavens, and gave offerings to the Weavers to alter reality, to alter fate. But it seemed this fate was to not be changed. She took solace when the Guldr told
her that her son, Hrothgar, was taken by the Choosers to the Halls of Glory.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated upon witnessing the grief of a mother, Karelia.
The Weavers oversee the fate of humanity, weaving the great tapestry of life and death, the Great Tale of all the
worlds from the First Dawn to the Last Night, when the Father of Wolves will devour the Sun and the Moon. While
some believe that the Weavers can direct or alter fate, others claim they are neutral observers, recording all actions,
good and evil, in their tapestry.
The Choosers of the Slain are the overseers of battles. Warriors who fall in battle whose deeds have impressed the
Choosers are taken to the Halls of Glory. There they rest until the Last Night, when they shall ride with the vanguarde
in the final battle against the Father of Wolves and the Great Serpent.

Symbols: A spinning wheel, a winged warrior

#### The Fathers of Giants, The Lords of Discord, Ice and Fire

“The warriors looked about with fear at what was to come. The enemy outnumbered them tenfold, and the thought of retreat had crossed more than one
mind. But their leader, Yrsa the Shield Breaker, turned to them and said ‘How can you fear this little battle when our blood survived the war between
the Fathers of Giants? Do not be so weak.’ And she bade them charge, and they found their resolve once more.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated during the Stand of Thirty Shields, Kvenland.
Always are these two worshiped together, if they are worshipped at all. Some believe this will allow the extremes of
one to balance out the extremes of the other. Some believe it will simply keep them warring amongst themselves
rather than turning their ire elsewhere.
It said by some skalds that the Lords of Discord are older than the rest of the pantheon, and that the world was
formed in the wake of their warring. After Ice had cooled the Fire and the Fire melted the Ice, the world arose from
what was left.

Symbols: A stylized flame, an icicle

#### The Father of Wolves and The Great Serpent, They Who Stalk Outside

“There stood Wealglist, with hatred and bitterness in his eyes. His body torn, his life pouring out of him. He looked to the mighty heroes that had laid
him low, and cursed them.
‘May your blood suffer The Last Night, may the Father of Wolves devour your people and The Great Serpent crush your bones to meal. And may you
always hear my laughter, and the laughter of my thirsting gods!’”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated at the death of Wealglist the Twisted, Ultima Thule.
The Father of Wolves and the Great Serpent are counted among the pantheon, but even among the Skandians
worship of them is forbidden. The Last Night and the end of all things will begin when the Father of Wolves at last
consumes the Sun and the Moon. Then will the Great Serpent rise up from the seas and crush the world within his
coils. Some believe it necessary to make offerings of meat and mead to the Father of Wolves to ensure that he is kept
fat and will be too slow to catch the Sun and Moon. Most, however, believe this only strengthens him.

Symbols: A serpent eating its own tail, a fang

#### Frid, the Peace Bringer, the Guardian of the Flock

“Brother stood against brother, axes glinting in the sun, shields raised in anticipation. But brave Bera would not have it, she would not see her sons shed
one another's blood. She called to Frid, asking for her aid in bringing peace. It was in that moment that Frid lit the way to their father’s lost sword so
that peace may be restored. The two brothers then raised shields together against the trolls that had stolen it.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated during the Blood Feud, Norroway.
The most commonly worshipped god by farmers and herders, Frid is a god of the fields and forests. When strife
breaks out within the family, Frid is the one invoked to restore peace and familial bonds. Indeed when new life is born
and a family made, Frid is asked to bless and watch over the new life and the new family. It is quite common to find
followers of Frid throughout the country side. It is believed her messengers are the animals one tends to find on
farms such as sheep, goats and cows, while her guardians are dogs.

Symbols: Dogs, a shepherd’s crook

#### Kaede, the Trickster, the Cunning One, the Breaker of Chains, the Bound One

“Halldora had found her way into the den of monsters. All others that had gone before her had never returned, and their bones lay strewn about that
wicked place. But Halldora had something the others did not; cleverness. The creatures, sightless but with the scent and hearing of wolves, did not hear
nor smell her approach. Indeed she had tricked them before arriving, offering them flesh covered in mud, so as to cover their nostrils. With the blessings of
Kaede she had summoned a swarm of crickets, whose great racket defeated the monsters. Halldora would walk away from that place with much treasure
and great prestige.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated after Halldoras Monster Heist, Norroway.
Kaede stands outside the walls, alone among wolves, but free from the obligations of society. Ancient stories say that
once Kaede resided within the halls of Wothir where he ever played tricks upon the others. Whether he was cast out
and bound within the wilds far from the warmth and light of the mead hall or broke the chain that bound him to
Wothir’s table of his own choice and escaped is unclear. Worship of him is not forbidden, but those who choose
Kaede as their most esteemed deity are often viewed with suspicion.

Symbols: a chain with a broken link, a knotted cord

#### Karlek, the Lover, the Destroyer, the Winged One

“And hands were joined in harmonious marriage, those attending invoking Karlek’s blessing upon the two. But such tidings of gladness did not last, as
Vikar, a jealous suitor, broke down the oaken doors. He too invoked Karlek’s name, but for blood and battle as his axe found its way into the chest of
the groom.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated at the Wedding of Sorrow, Norroway.
Karlek is a goddess of contradictions. While she is called upon to bless lovers and oversee weddings, she is also
invoked in battle. As passion can bring love and joy, so too can such emotions fuel wrath and destruction. Karlek is
both. In her followers there is much debate about the truth behind her actions, as guldr try to decipher if she is
pleased or displeased. Regardless of theology, Karlek is a favorite amongst warriors, in particular by warrior couples
and lovers, as they seem to walk the thin line of Karleks contractions.

Symbols: A heart pierced by a sword, falcons, cats

#### Mistelten, the Son, the Bright One, Hope

“The seers had foreseen great struggle, and Torvald was well aware of the power of his chaotic foes. He had sallied forth, his sword glistening in the sun as
he charged the foe. It seemed hopeless to those watching upon the walls, but he cried to the heavens for Mistelten to protect him, and all found hope restored
as the fell strikes of the horrid chaos worshippers did no harm to him. All those watching found their courage and charged forth, saving the city from
doom.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated, siege of the town of Longhall, Norroway.
Mistelten looks ever to the future and is patron of soothsayers and fortune tellers. Seen as a beacon of hope, Mistelten
was blessed with long lasting life and the ability to see into the future. Mistelten uses these abilities to aid his followers,
and it is said that when all seems lost a prayer to Mistelten can turn the tide for the truly righteous.

Symbols: the sun, a harp, rune stones

#### Valna- The Stealer of Souls - The Half Eaten Hag

“Halfgar held tightly the precious idol that belonged to his dear father, Halfgar the Elder. His blood soaking the earth beneath him, he looked at his
righteous pursuers who had run him through with arrow and with spear. As his life faded, the law men went to grab his now lifeless corpse and found it
as ice to the touch. The men wavered and fled, for Valna was near and had claimed another, taking the wayward soul to her icy halls of judgement.”
Excerpt from “The Saga of Heroes” by Hrani the Educated, Kvenland.
While the valiant dead may find their place in the Halls of Glory, the ignoble dead are claimed by Valna. The
oathbreakers, the cowards, the thieves, and villains of all stripes go to her cold and dark halls when their lives are
extinguished. When her name is invoked it to call down a curse rather than a blessing.

Symbols: Skulls, bones, spiders
