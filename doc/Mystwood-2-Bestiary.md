## Local Genesis of “Monsters”

Many philosophers, witch hunters, knights Templar, and the like have studied the creatures which plague humanity in various areas. It has been observed that the strength and nature of the supernatural varies, depending on location and the peoples who dwell nearby. Thus, a peaceful village in the heart of well-patrolled lands is unlikely to be troubled by great monsters regularly. On the other hand, a superstitious folk dwelling in a land known for stories of gods, men, and monsters is likely to be harassed regularly by all manner of creatures drawn from myth and folklore. The incursions of Chaos, depredations of war, and the panic spread by rumor all serve their part in engendering new horrors to plague humanity. It is believed that one day, when the Three have triumphed, such monsters, supernatural plagues, and evil phenomena which serve to harm mankind will finally be undone.

Regardless of area, there are several orders of beings that are common. These creatures are listed below.

# Explanation of this Book

## Stats and Game Balance

Mystwood is a “fixed stats” game. Some games “float” NPC stats so that the players always win after a tough fight, key NPCs always survive battles, etc. The low fantasy aspect of Mystwood however means that sometimes the players lose their battles, and you should always be prepared with a “failure loop” to handle this. It also means that sometimes big NPCs get killed unexpectedly, so you need some way to handle this also.

The stats in this book are baseline stats compiled from GM’s. These are here to help and standardize stats for creatures, while recommended, Chronicle runners and GM’s should not feel forced to use them and are free to adjust how you see fit. There are 3 different strengths for each creature listed (weak, normal, and strong) indicated by a color coded system. Some stats may be listed like **(X/X/X)** indicating weak, normal, and strong versions in that order, others may have the strength called out such as in this example.

| **Goblin**       |                                                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HP:**          | **2/4/7**                                                                 |
| **Specials:**    | **0/1/2**                                                                 |
| **Resists:**     | **(Strong) 1** Resist Will                                                |
| **Immunities:**  | None                                                                      |
| **Weaknesses:**  | None, but some goblins may be afraid of fire or magic                     |
| **Other Notes:** | They like to set up ambushes and traps, they also occasionally use poison |

## Eternal Foe

Unless otherwise specified, when someone Detects Eternal Foe Fae, Undead, or Chaos and receives a response they gain 1 Extra special attack against that Eternal Foe Target.

## Deadly Abilities

Some monsters may have very deadly abilities such as “Deathstrike”, “Death by magic”, etc. These are powerful abilities and should be used with caution. While it makes sense for certain monsters to be this deadly it is advised that these abilities should be used towards the middle and end of a fight. It can be upsetting to be taken out of a fight early on and have to wait until combat is over.

## Loot

It is possible to run a chronicle with little treasure. However, as a rough guide 5 crowns per player is a good guideline plus magic items equal to the number of players/3, and materials and components equal to the number of players.

It is a good idea to vary the WAY the treasure is distributed. Consider a mix between:

“The Big Score” - a large pile of treasure that players may or may not share. This is fun, but often some players will wind up with nothing,

“Loot and Pillage” - treasure that comes in small amounts, usually from looting enemies. This results in more distribution between players and rewards those who are “energetic”, but some players will be left out, especially those who are not heavy combatants.

“Reward and Largess” - the players are paid, individually or en mass, for their efforts. This is the most reliable way to get treasure to all players.

It is possible to give moonstones instead of crown - this is ideal when the players perform idealistic actions such as helping peasants, which would not “realistically” give much monetary reward. Magic items are great as well. Because they expire after a year, players get to use them, enjoy them, and then they are gone without unbalancing the game. Anything in Mystwood could be a magic item - you don’t need to worry too much about why a soldier has a magic sword. It need not have been forged specially, it may just have taken on some of its wielder’s valor.

# NPC Conventions

### Fair Escape

At times, players and NPCs will be chasing each other around in the woods. Player characters fleeing from monsters can generally escape by reaching the town, but it's a bit harder for NPCs. NPCs with players in pursuit cannot simply sprint to the NPC building, since it is out of game and that would be unfair. Instead, they must get out of line of sight from players and remain motionless for 3 minutes. If they do that successfully, they are considered to have slipped away into a swamp or the like. The NPC may then become a spirit and return to the NPC building.

### Recycling

At times, NPCs may "recycle" or "re-spawn" to represent new enemies arriving to join a battle. Generally, they can only do so a limited number of times, how many times being determined by the plot and the person running the module.

Area Recycling: When area recycling is used, NPCs must move out of line of sight of the players and wait

for a specified amount of time (usually a minute) before returning.

Gate Recycling: In this form of recycling, NPCs emerge from some sort of gate or door- be it a Chaos portal or rat hole. They may call a "Disengage" when they emerge.

Totem Recycling: In this form, when NPCs die they become spirits and travel to a talisman, banner or the like. Once they tag it, they may then return to the battle. If a PC is within 10 feet of the totem, NPCs may not "tag in" and should stay out of the way.

### Spirit

Some creatures are visible, but not in touch with normal reality. Most commonly, these are Fae or ghosts who can make use of their innate abilities to pass unharmed in the mortal world. Effects which are “to Spirit” or to the trait the creatures possess will still harm them, however, so for example a Fae thinking itself protected will be quite surprised by a character making use of the spell “Castigation of Cassandra” on them.

More commonly for player characters is the Spirit state which is the result of Death, as a character moves from where one died to the local Miracle of Resurrection. A player character who is dead, and a spirit, can only be affected by “Speak to Spirit”- call “No Effect” to anything else.

# Creating a Monster

When creating a monster you will want to have a good understanding of what you are trying to make. Below is a list of things to consider when creating a new monster or taking a spin on an existing one.

**Description:** What does it look like, Costuming and Weapons?

**Backstory of the creature:** What is it? Was it created in a special way?

**Habitat:** Where can it be found or where does it usually live?

**Society:** Does it live in a group, how do they act together, rituals, habits, etc…

**Any Interesting Lore or History:** Do they have a hatred of or work with other creatures?

**Behaviors:** How does the creature usually act, are there things that change its behavior?

**Combat:** How does it fight, any interesting tactics?

**Abilities:** Any cool, thematic, or unique abilities that make it stand out?

**Weaknesses:** Ideally most creatures should have some sort of weakness even if it is a minor one and isn't extremely detrimental.

# Chaos

Chaos, the Great Enemy of Mankind, comes in many forms. Cultists dwell secretly in every city, corrupting their neighbors and friends to sin. The Knights of Teutonia serve the Lords of Chaos in parody of goodly kingdoms, mutants haunt the forests, and daemons contrive ways to leave their strange realms to corrupt reality. As cults, mutants, and daemons are common throughout Europa, most have heard a tiny bit about these things, but Chaos is fickle and fecund, and the best assumption when facing Chaos is to expect nothing.

**The Way of chaos:**

The warrior of rage, sword sworn of the sisters of slaughter

The sorcerers of Intrigue, pawns of the twisted path

The cultivators of Corruption, servants of the Grandfathers of plague

The seekers of pleasure, slaves of the Lord of Desire

The taskmasters of Minutiae, ordinals of the Uncountable Name

The children of Greed, exemplars of the twin Wyrms

The guardians of sloth, taken of the thing in the Dark

The lost and the Damned, playthings of the Thousand Voices

Beastman are minions of the sisters while Bird daemons are of the Twisted Path/Changer of ways

Devout followers of Chaos may receive extra abilities depending on who they follow.

**- Check with GM’s and Chronicle runners first to see if they want to use them.**

Sisters of Slaughter - 1 Extra Special

Pawns of the Twisted Path - 1 Disguising Glamor

Grandfathers of Plague - 1 Heal 3 to Self

Lord of Desire - 1 Charm by Will

Taskmasters of Minutiae - 1 Free Disengage

Children of Greed - 1 Detect crown and frenzy to self

Guardians of Sloth - Feign Death

Thousand Voices - 1 Enslave by Magic

# Cults

Cults of Chaos come in many forms, with wildly different ways based on the vice which is preferred by the Cult. Chaos cults fight amongst themselves nearly as much as they fight against law and civilization, and two cults both nominally allegiant to a given vice may fight to the death upon encountering one another.

Throughout Europa, there are many hundreds of cults, though a few in service to mighty powers of Chaos permeate the nations- The Sisters of Slaughter, the Changer of Ways, and the Grandfather are all great beings of Chaos whose cults are common and widespread. Most common folk know nothing more than the names of these cults and that they leave horror and death in their wake.

Some Daemon worshiping cults will perform rituals to ascend lesser daemons, this could be from example turning a Crowling into a Scraeling, in order to gain favor, magic power, control over the daemon, and other things.

# Daemons

Worse than Beastmen are the Daemons of Chaos. Creatures of pure Chaos, they are summoned briefly into the mortal world for purposes of mayhem, after which they disappear once more. They have a thousand forms, from the least warriors and nuisances, to greater Daemons of enormous power and intellect. Often they come in near unending waves from gates, portals, or icons. Thankfully such occasions are rare.

**Demonic possession? And exorcism?**

Demonic possession varies, what works for one vessel and one daemon might not work for another.

**Traits:**

**Lesser Daemon:** “Detect Eternal Foe Chaos” at will. Lesser Daemons cannot give chaos marks.

**Daemon:** “Detect Eternal Foe Chaos” at will. Daemons can sometimes bestow a chaos mark on someone who accepts it willingly.

**Greater Daemon:** “Detect Eternal Foe Chaos” at will. Greater Daemons can bestow marks on unwilling victims, but they still require some kind of gap in the person’s defenses - an existing chaos mark, a failed challenge, a tainted item. They also have the ability to “Heal 1” 3 times on a mortal. They will use this to heal a fallen player, then offer them a choice – accept a mark of chaos or die. If the player accepts the mark they will “afflict you with a mark of Chaos” and let them go. Otherwise they will stab them for a “doom”.

\- Notes on Trapping Daemons from Greg Farris

The nature of daemons and their summoning makes true destruction of them a difficult task. Simply attacking a daemon until it “dies” usually only undoes the summoning on it, allowing it to potentially be resummoned later. An alternative is instead to trap the daemon in some vessel, binding it in the world. Boxes, mirrors, wells, and trees are common vessels, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

The method of trapping a daemon must be tailored to the type of daemon. There are several methods. A daemon of fear might be confronted with something it fears, causing it to flee into . Conversely a daemon of greed might be tempted into a trap with a pile of wealth. In general, the trap should be something that will both fascinate and contain a daemon. For a daemon such as the Fibonnacian, a box containing a complex puzzle or set of gears would likely work to fascinate it.

Ideas

Nightmare

Familiar

Shade or shadow demon - Greater demon

Fear daemon- weakness is a specific fear

Mirror daemon?

Demon that uses either by gesture or by name effects?

Born from the bodies that have not been buried and left to decay, especially those that have been killed by disease but are not limited by that. Known for carrying diseases such as swift rot, bloody flux are the most common.

Live in swamps, poorly kept midden heaps. First conceived during the great plagues.

Servants of the Daemon of the grandfather of plague. No smarter than insects, some level of intelligence but mostly to consume and spread disease. Hit and run combat tactics like a mosquito, but will strike if given the opportunity.

| **Traits Explained:**             | “Detect Eternal Foe Chaos” at will. Greater Daemons can bestow marks on unwilling victims, but they still require some kind of gap in the person’s defenses - an existing chaos mark, a failed challenge, a tainted item. They also have the ability to “Heal 1” 3 times on a mortal. They will use this to heal a fallen player, then offer them a choice – accept a mark of chaos or die. If the player accepts the mark they will “afflict you with a mark of Chaos” and let them go. Otherwise they will stab them for a “doom”.                                          |

Servant of Sisters of slaughter daemon or playthings of the uncounted name. Taskmaster controlling daemon. Created by Someone who will injure themselves in the name of the 3, in front of the shrine of mercy to strengthen themself during battle, justice to turn chaos away, wild to help crops or empower a hunt. But what happens when a flagellant falls to chaos believing that they no longer alone can bear the sins of man and will turn to other people, even unwilling participants and will flagellate them and that's where their fall to chaos begins. Executioners who believe that they can better carry out the law by themselves, will execute people without going to trial.

Live near herdstones where there is a lot of fighting, cultist camps, places where there is alot of fighting,

Hatred of every other creature and firmly believe every other creature should be beneath them. Except mages, they are the scum of the earth and are disgusting.

The forming of these twisted fortress-like chaos-spawn is a mystery to many but one does not need to understand how they are made to be able to destroy them. The most readily available method of provoking these devils seems to be attempting to selfishly toy with the matrixes of power at the crossroads some distance from the Keep's front gates. All followers of the Three are forbidden from doing so, as with all of chaos, any gain that might have come to the hapless fool toying with the matrix is quickly undone at the expense of all others nearby. Such is the insidious, perverting nature of all the powers of chaos that any bargain, no matter the reason it be struck, must come to fruition with the deaths and suffering of many more than might have otherwise experienced mundane, survivable woes. Of note, the construction of new types of castle demons –specifically undead ones– seems to have been mastered by an alliance of petty followers of chaos and a would-be necromancer. Little is known about this variant as of yet but they should be engaged only with extreme caution. The extent of their terribleness has not yet been discovered fully.

With the normal castle demons one can expect a lumbering stone-skinned biped armed with the largest weapons. Their twisted, evil faces peer out of a parapet-like casing of armor. Terrible crushing blows capable of killing an armored soldier in one strike are the standard, not the exception, when facing castle demons. Note that you will almost never find one alone. Castle demons are always encountered in at least pairs, often with lesser chaotic spawn or beastmen. This serves them well as they are slow moving for one but also that if one castle demon falls and the other not brought low in short order, the second seems to be able to regenerate the first. They must be carefully chipped at, as if sieging a walking pair of towers, and felled at nearly the same instant. This is, unfortunately, easier said than done. Their bodies are all but impervious to conventional strikes. Only the strongest blows from brave warriors, or the arcane elements of spells, passion, or magical items will have any effect. However, they are more wicked still. Their protective magics shift like the muck of a putrid swamp, seemingly always in the same order. Mark the order well and memorize it. It will save your life.

The first strike that has sufficient strength to go through the stone of its hide will always be shrugged off as if nothing has happened. The second strike will always turn against the origin, ensuring the brave defender suffers the effects of their own strike. It is the third strike of sufficient strength that will sink past all defenses and harm the foul demon inside. Note that until you determine where in this rotation the castle demon's defenses are, you should refrain from deadly blows that you yourself could not survive, lest the reflective, blade-turning magic guide your own sword into your throat.

| **Behaviors:**                    | The Rhakshasa is a playful, but cruel creature.

| **Traits Explained:**             | “Detect Eternal Foe Chaos” at will. Greater Daemons can bestow marks on unwilling victims, but they still require some kind of gap in the person’s defenses - an existing chaos mark, a failed challenge, a tainted item. They also have the ability to “Heal 1” 3 times on a mortal. They will use this to heal a fallen player, then offer them a choice – accept a mark of chaos or die. If the player accepts the mark they will “afflict you with a mark of Chaos” and let them go. Otherwise they will stab them for a “doom”. |

# Elementals

Chaos is not responsible for all the daemons that find their way to the mortal world. While less common, Elementals are the daemonic counterparts of the other elements besides Chaos- Air, Fire, Life, and the like. Where ley lines cross, or places of great connection to an elemental plane can be found, elementals follow. Some form from the natural world, while others are beings of great power and age which normally dwell in strange places of their pure element and only visit Europa when called by magicians, or for their own inscrutable purposes.

Many elementals are mindless, existing only to rampage the lands or protect the wellspring that formed them. Others are sentient, even named, and can be bargained with or even served.

## Elemental Lords

Like the cults of Chaos, the other Elements- Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and even Death, Life, and Time- have mighty beings who are able to bestow a variety of benefits to mortals who swear themselves to service. The Elemental Lords are not gods, though, and do not grant miracles. Instead, choosing to serve the Elemental Lords generally entails doing them favors and services in exchange for bestowed powers and elemental Components.

No player character may begin the game in service to the Elemental Lords, but may discover means to do so in game through role play. Service to the Elemental Lords does not require that one cease worship of the Three, however, while serving the Elemental Lords characters may neither gain nor spend Karma.

## Elemental Kinship

Those who share some bond with nature might possess certain affinities to Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. This is often passed down from generation to generation.

**Example Costuming:** Lip stick, eye makeup, or skin highlights- yellow or white for Air, green or brown for Earth, orange or red for Fire, and blue or blue-green for Water.

**Common Advantages:** Call of Freedom (Air) Elemental Fury, Elemental Resistance, Natural Armor (Earth or Water), Stonefast (Earth), Witchblood

**Common Disadvantages:** Pristine, Slow (Earth), Vulnerability, Wild Heart (Water)

# Elves

In the beginning before the years knew numbers and the lands knew names there was nothing but an endless wilderness. Every tree and creature was touched with enchantment and the world as a child discovering how to walk, under the endless wheel of the sun and moon. Out of the sun dappled shadows between trees came the first wild elves, they were wise and patient and understood the language of the world. From the stones of mountains rose the Duergar, they were stout and crafty and shaped the bones of the earth with only their hands. From the tusks and hides of beasts awoke the Orcs. They were strong and honorable, they soothed the savage creatures and fostered the timid.

The Children of the Dawning World came to each other and made a pact. They would respect the world that bore them and make it a place for themselves to live in harmony with it. The elves gave their great tower to always keep watch, the dwarves gave their silver golems to tend and shape the land, and the orcs gave a relic of their heritage to promise service eternally. So the three people brought the world to a harmonious form, and for what was to be eternity the sun and moon watched and turned always overhead. The changing of the world followed the quicklings, the humans. They named their Gods, marked their borders, and numbered their years. Their Justice was domination. Their Wild was exploitation. And their Mercy was slaughter. They broke the branches of the ageless trees and drowned the soil and rivers in blood. They brought with them time and in their wake ages flowed forward and the eternal cycle drifted towards entropy.

The final insult of the quicklings was their Elf Slayer. His crusade would not end until he had purged the world of the people of the forest. Sensing the end the elves willed to live no longer in this world of horrors. The Duerger returned to their mountain homes. The Orcs became lost and savage. Thus ends the eternal age, and begins the counted years.

**Elves: [Ideas - nothing set in stone]**

-   During the last war with Time, the Elves en mass were taken/returned/conscripted to Faerie.
-   Elves possessed a magic that allowed them to pass back and forth between Worlds.
-   The Elves were originally also denizens of Faerie. Their ancestors were exiled from Faerie for [something that isn’t just blatantly ripping off Tolkein]. While they retained their ability to “slip” between worlds, they were barred from Faerie and instead learned how to exploit the space between the worlds to travel quickly and unseen. Thus why the Ways are also called Elf Roads.
-   Elves were humans once. In the dawn of the world, the first humans to delve into Sorcery and magic became changed by their experiments.
-   Elves are what happen when pure magic becomes sentient but in an ordered way instead of a chaotic way. The Fae ate them.
-   Elves are what happen when humans fornicate with Time elementals.
-   The Elves are actually still around. They are just very very small.
-   Elves were destroyed by the forces of Chaos and Faerie who wanted to have control over beings that were manifestations of magic.
-   Some stories say there was a war between the elves and the orcs and they lost that war and that was the end of them on Terra.

The race of Elves and their civilization vanished many centuries ago and little is known of them beyond the stories. Indeed, the most common remnant of their civilization are the children born with pointed ears. These subtle signs of elven ancestry may appear in every generation of a particular family or may appear seemingly at random in a family that otherwise shows no signs of non-human ancestry.

Precisely what happened to the Elves is unknown. However, there are several theories based on the old stories, rare artifacts and even rarer ruins that have been found.

One ancient dwelling was recently near the village of Burgundar that dated from before the founding of Aquila. Within it were fragments of writings and wall murals that spoke of a war between Elves and Orcs. The outcome of the war was not recorded, but some murals suggested that the Elven civilization was already in significant decline at the time of conflict. Whether or not this conflict was the end of the Elves is a matter of speculation.

A second theory proposed by some scholars is that the Elves were destroyed in conflict with Chaos. Indeed, this theory is lent credence by the fights with the Chaos Knight known as the Elf-Slayer or the Eater of Music who hunted down any who showed signs of Elven heritage.

Another theory still draws from the many stories that sometimes conflate Elves with Fae, or otherwise suggest close kinship between the two. As the Elves found themselves beset by a multitude of enemies, they faded from the Mortal world and returned to Faerie. It is noted that Titania of the Summer Court is sometimes also called the Queen of Elfhome. If this is true and the Elves reside now in Faerie, then none have ever ventured back to the Mortal world.

## Elfin Ancestry

Long ago the Elves lived and flourished and are believed to have died out many hundreds of years ago. Some old stories say that they were masters of magic and it was they who first taught humans spellcraft. Others say they lived in harmony with nature, able to speak with plants and beasts as easily as breathing. Yet all that is known for certain is that their civilization vanished and the only traces left to prove they were ever here are the scattered children who still bear the pointed ears of their ancestors.

Hideous creatures that despise the sun. Thus, they live in the murky underground and stay in the shadows when above. They are responsible for nightmares, sitting on the chest of sleeping folk and whispering bad dreams into their ears. Some say that dark elves cannot be exposed to sunlight, lest they be turned to stone.

Fair and mysterious. Light elves are gifted magic users. They are not often seen by the likes of men, except when men are in great need of inspiration or help, and are working against the forces of Chaos and/or the Unseelie Court.

*Remember, my child, the gifts of the elves*

*Wonder and magic and story and song*

*High in their trees or deep in their delves*

*Calling the curious to come, come along*

*Come learn at the side of the children of light*

*Wonder and magic and story and song*

*And dance by the fireside all through the night*

*Calling the curious to come, come along*

*Remember, my child, the fall of the elves*

*Wonder and magic and story and song*

*Gone are their trees and gone are the delves*

*No more shall the curious come, come along*

*Come learn from the loss of the children of light*

*Wonder and magic and story and song*

*And watch for the wolf lord who stalks in the night*

*No more shall the curious come, come along*

# Fae

**Disclaimer:** Different Triads often prefer to handle the fae in different ways - some are more comic, while others prefer darker or more Elven fae. Therefore, it is generally best to establish your own Fae Court with its own Lords and Ladies so that you can run them the way you prefer to. All Fae should be able to turn to spirit to avoid being killed.

Less easily categorized are the wilder Fae- woses, pucks, kelpies, korreds, sprites, sylphs, and the like. It may be that they are elementals of some form, or that they are manifestations of the god of the Wild in some way, or something else altogether. Certainly, they are mischievous and powerful, talented in the arts of magic, long lived and restive. The Fae themselves give few answers to their origin or true nature and an answer given by one may entirely contradict an answer given by another. The Fae themselves are largely silent on their ultimate origins and abilities, though a few things are known.

In form Fae come in a dizzying array of appearances. Some may appear almost human, save for strangely colored hair, horns, or other such markings. Others may take forms that seem to be made entirely of bark or moss or as odd animals. A few take forms stranger still. In all their myriad of seemings, however, it is as likely that their appearance is a veil of glamor disguising their true shape, which is often shabby and unkempt.

Some fae, especially the so called common fae, link themselves to elements, places, animals or the like and take up traits of those beings. The more powerful make use of mind-affecting magic called glamors to appear as regal lords and ladies of men, but usually with strange variations, such as pointed ears, wings, horns and the like.

The disposition of Fae towards humans is as varied as their forms. Some enjoy the company of mortals and have even been known to intermarry with humans on rare occasions. Others are adversarial, and delight in causing harm and misfortune. Most fall somewhere in between, but even the friendliest of the Fae can become a deadly foe if offended.

While Fae are often skilled in many forms of magic, they are masters of glamor, a form of illusion that beguiles the will. Many are the stories of folks who have been tricked by faerie gold, only discovering later that what they thought was gold and gems to be no more than leaves and stones disguised by glamor. So, too, the Fae use glamor to alter their own appearances, changing their faces to match their current fancy.

Unlike humans, Fae generally do not trade in coin or goods. Rather, they trade in favors and boons. As powerful and long lived beings, Fae can sometimes offer help or information, but will expect a favor in return that they may call upon at a later time. A Fae who has been angered might also be appeased if the one who offended them offers a favor as compensation. Similarly, if a human renders aid to a Fae, they may find themselves gifted a favor. Yet, beware, for Fae are well known for twisting words to ensure they come out ahead in any bargain struck.

Most fae are mischievous and powerful, talented in the arts of magic, long lived and restive. The fae are known to never lie, but they often speak in such a way as to mislead and trick the listener. Their culture makes use of favors owed and due as bargaining chips in the unknown economies of their nations, which are called Courts. The greatest Courts are the Seelie, who aspect themselves toward sun, summer, fire and emulating human nobility; and the Unseelie, who aspect themselves towards cold, darkness, night, and the terror of the dark forest. There are many other Courts of Fae, as well as independent fae of many types.

**Courts**

Seelie: Also called the Court of Summer, the Seelie are ruled by Queen Titania and King Oberon. In their train are the flower faeries, the pucks, and the Knights of Summer among others. These are the bright ones, the beautiful fay who have charmed and inspired bards and poets alike throughout the ages. The Knights of Summer, in particular, exemplify the ideas of honor and chivalry, riding out on knightly tasks, bedecked in capes of flowers to win their Lady’s favor. As a whole, the Seelie are generally well disposed towards humans, being more inclined to mischief rather than malice.

Unseelie: Sometimes called the Winter Court, the Unseelie are ruled by Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness. In her court can be found those Fae that delight in trickery and malice. Hers are the Red Caps, the Banshees, the Night Hags, and all others that embrace decay. They revel in coarseness and laugh at the very concept of courtly romance their Seelie counter parts so treasure. While generally more antagonistic towards humans, they will still readily make deals and trade in favors.

Other Courts: While the Seelie and Unseelie are the largest and most powerful of the Fae courts, there are many smaller Courts who maintain their independence through one means or another. Often these are bound to specific places and their members rarely travel far from their places of power. Two of the best known examples are the Ungerard Court, ruled by a pair of brother princes, and the Underhill Court, ruled by a council of four.

Unaligned: Some Fae, for one reason or another, align themselves with no court. Some are so minor as to avoid the notice of any of the Courts, while others, are singularly powerful enough to repel even the Queens of the Seelie and Unseelie should they approach uninvited. These Fae are more unpredictable than those pledged to a Court as they serve no master but themselves and can be great friend or bitter enemy to humans, but more often than not simply wish to be left alone.

**Mortal Servants  
**Some of the mighty Fae Lords and Ladies accept mortal servants, usually for their own amusement. It is claimed by some that mortals can become Fae, and Fae mortal, by forswearing certain aspects of their nature, but the process of this is unknown.

No player character may begin the game in service to a Fae court, but may discover means to do so in game through role play. Service to the Fae does not require that one cease worship of the Three, however, joining a Fae Court permanently, or becoming a Fae, will result in the character becoming an NPC whose further story is entirely in the hands of the Chapter Game Masters, to do with as they please.

**The Faerie Realm**

Most Fae reside within the land of Faerie, a realm of glittering castles spun from gossamer thin glass, forests full of twisted paths with trees ready to eat anyone foolish enough to step off the path, and things far stranger still. Time passes differently in Faerie. A person may spend but a single night at a Faerie ball only to return home in the morning to find a hundred years have passed. Conversely, a quartet of siblings might find themselves spirited away and spend many decades of adventure only to return home and find less than a minute has passed.

Passage to and from Faerie typically requires use of a “gate” of some sort. Commonly, these take the form of mushroom circles or Waystones, but can also take many other forms. Fairy Mounds and Fairy Trees are also common entrances to Faerie. Rarely, these gates may simply be open allowing anyone to freely pass back and forth. Typically the gates require some special knowledge to open. This may be a password, a special knock sequence, or a dance. Others may only be open at specific times, such as the first day of Summer or Winter. While a Fae guide may be helpful in finding or opening a gate, it is not necessary.

Some gates will take the traveler directly to Faerie, but others will instead allow access to the “Elf Roads”. Also referred to as The Ways, The Gray Paths, or the Hedge, these are a liminal space that lies between Faerie and the human realm that is part of both and neither. These can be used to travel great distances in moments and reach places otherwise inaccessible. These are powered by sleeping fae, who require the dreams of half the party using the way to make it work.

**Asking for a Mortal’s Name**

When a Fae asks for the name of a Mortal there are some rules that they Fae **MUST** follow. First they must ask for the Mortals name in such a way that conveys being “Given” the name. Such as “May I have your name”, “Would you give me your name”, this is generally said while reaching your hand out almost as if you are expecting them to literally give you their name. Knowledgeable players will know what to say to get around this such as, “You may call me”, “You may Refer to me as”, or they may just give you a false name. As a general rule this should not be used against new players as that may be considered unfair and taking advantage of their limited knowledge.

What happens once a name has been given to a Fae is not mechanically written out. In general, when given a name it means that the Fae owns your story and may adjust or change things as they see fit. What this means mechanically is more on a case by case basis. But if a fae needed to they could "compel by name" There is no carrier - it can only be resisted by a resist anything. Generally, using the mechanical compel should be a last resort, as just the vague threat is usually enough. Fae should also be willing to trade back a player's name in exchange for something of equal value, usually a quest.

**Hidden Lore Regarding Faerie:**

While humanity struggles against it’s great enemy in the form of Chaos, Faerie has already defeated it’s greatest foe - Time. Thus Faerie has been made “perfect”. The Fae do not know true conflict or sorrow as humans do. They do not age or die. The political maneuvering of the Courts is but a game, one in which one side wields a poisoned flower and the other a hidden knife, but a game nonetheless. In the end, it is a realm that is unchanging in any truly meaningful way.

As Time does not hold sway in Faerie, Fae themselves do not age or die, but they can be killed. Similarly, they do not bear children in the way of humans. This is why the Fae will steal away human children or transform adult humans who gain their fancy into Fae as that is the only manner by which the species can propagate.

Standard fae stats are 4-8 HP, 1 resist any and if hit with something they will shift to spirit and run away.

## Banshee

Vengeful spirit of a woman betrayed. Glad in pale garments, these creatures are mistaken for forlorn women sobbing. When approached, their visage warps, and they screech a mind numbing howl. They consume the souls of their victims creating ![](media/5d4138040d5208156422b8156e142650.png)husks of humans.

Banshees, also known as "woman of the fairy mounds" or wailing women, are said to herald the deaths of others through keening, singing and shrieking. However, they do not bring death, they warn of it. If someone is about to enter a situation where it is unlikely they will come out alive she will warn people by screaming or wailing. When the Banshee calls for one whom they love, her song is a soft notice of death but with tenderness. But if the call is for an enemy of the Banshee, it is a scream filled with demonic delight over their ensuing death. When several banshees appear at once, it indicates great tragedy or the death of someone great or holy.

Banshees are mysterious beings and no one knows exactly what a banshee is, whether it is a Ghost or spirit, Fae, or Daemon. For in truth it may be all of these things. Banshees are known to have a variety of abilities, some of which are unique and are not shared amongst all of their kind. Some legends say she only keens while combing her hair. Some say that looking directly into their eyes will cause death or that her wail can shatter objects. Others say that they will vanish into a cloud of mist if seen by others,

According to some tales, there are evil Banshees that derive pleasure from taking a life and they actively seek out their victims and wail at them to the point where the person commits suicide or goes insane.

They are predominantly aligned with the unseelie court but some are unaligned.

What was once a friendly and helpful Brownie is now a malicious and mischievous Boggart. Once a Boggart is turned they become a nuisance, surly, unpredictable, malevolent and are very difficult to placate. In some cases a simple apology is all that is needed to return a Boggart to the friendly Brownie he was before the offense, other times simple understanding and acts of kindness will bring them back to their original state. In other cases it may take much more to bring them round. And in still other cases nothing can be done to pacify them. In this instance they will become a full time Boggart. The only thing one can do is move from their old home to a new one. But even then the Boggart may follow the family to their new residence.

A Boggart causes mischief and likes to play tricks on the home's residents. They often turn milk sour, make animals upset and release them to run wild and cause things to disappear, and can also turn your fortune bad. They can even murder or steal children if angered enough. They enjoy frightening people, typically doing poltergeist-like activities and poltergeists are commonly blamed when it is actually a boggart.

Some describe it as a shapeshifter covered in hair and say it has a terrible stench and that even if you can't see it, you might be able to smell it. They tend to live outdoors, in marshland, holes in the ground, under bridges and on dangerous sharp bends on roads.

Boggarts should never be named, for when the Boggart is given a name, it will become enraged. Uncontrollable and destructive, it cannot be reasoned with nor persuaded. Hanging a horseshoe on the door of a house and leaving a pile of salt outside is said to keep a boggart away.

Brownies are shy house spirits who take care of chores. They are solitary beings who enjoy doing household chores, and like to work with animals and are often friendly with house pets. In addition to house chores they herd the animals, care for the horses, milk the cows, mow, and finish chores which human servants didn't manage to finish, as well as many, many other things. Brownies typically do their work at night so they are less likely to be seen, however they do the work they are in the mood for and not what the master of the house would prefer they do.

Brownies don't like interacting with humans or being seen by them and can shapeshift into animals and turn invisible to hide from them. Despite this aversion, they are moved by friendships and relationships and are often much more attached to one of the household members than the others. Contrary to what most think, Brownies do not live inside of the homes they take care of but live close by outside in nature. Brownies are easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. They are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they will leave or in the worst cases they are said to turn into malicious Boggarts.

There are 4 rules one must follow if they wish to keep their Brownie happy and doing work. Do not observe them, do not criticize or mock them, do not be nice to them, and always give them regular offerings. Brownies are finicky and anything nice will have the opposite effect and force them to leave. However they like to find some food waiting for them while working, usually at the hearth of the home, such as milk, honey, porridge, or bread and occasionally enjoy a special dairy treat.

Gie Brownie a coat, gie Brownie a sark,

Ye'se get nae mair o' Brownie's wark.

The Bugul Noz, also called the Night Shepherd, is a fae spirit who lives in the woods. Some say that he is the last of his kind, but no one knows for sure since there are not many that have gotten close enough to know for certain. For he is said to be so incredibly ugly and that his appearance is so awful that even woodland animals avoid him. Some legends state that he is so hideous that on occasion those who look upon him would die instantly. His appearance causes him so much distress that he cries out to warn of his approach so that he won’t frighten anyone.

However, the Bugul Noz is not malicious, and is in fact kind and gentle. He often uses his ugliness to scare people back into their homes at night so they are safe and can avoid danger.

## Dryad/Sidhe Draoi

Dryads are shy benevolent guardians of the trees. All dryads are bound to a single tree that serves as both their life force and home. ![](media/19a63971f6d3b6c4955226a0121aea06.png)They are fiercely protective of their tree, as should their tree be cut or destroyed, they will suffer the same fate.

Dryads are the spirits of the trees and plants. Sometimes called nymphs or tree spirits. Each dryad is the spiritual embodiment of a specific tree. Usually female, they are most active at dusk and dawn. During the day they sleep within the trunk of their tree. In some regions, they are called Sidhe Draoi, and are more elf-like and fairy-like Druids.

Despite there being many varieties of dryads, they all share similar traits. They all are bound to a specific tree or, in the case of more powerful spirits, a grove of trees. Their lives are bound to their trees and if their tree is killed they will die as well. For this reason they rarely travel far from their tree. Rarely, there are some dryads that carry with them a seedling of their tree. These are usually fairly young and they are seeking a suitable place to, quite literally, put down roots. Dryads cannot travel far from their tree, and if taken too far from it will die shortly after. They might be able to have their connection to their tree severed by a rare exorcism spell. However, they will need to find a new tree or will eventually die.

Tree spirits are usually solitary, except for the occasional servant or charmed slave they keep with them. They will occasionally group together with other dryads. They avoid being seen by humans, except for very rare cases. In those rare instances, dryads are often seen singing and dancing with the wind and trees or playing with animals.

There are extraordinary stories of special individuals deemed worthy of receiving the Dryad’s Blessing (*Treewalk Advantage*), a rare magical boon that persists for a tree’s season. As well as rumors of a rare magical item that will allow a dryad to stray from their home, but no one knows for sure if they exist. And for only the most special or the most wicked individuals, there is the “Wood From a Dryad’s Tree” a rare magical item used in unique crafts and rituals, an item that may be gifted by a dryad as a piece of the tree that has naturally fallen off or a part of the tree that has been felled and harvest by only the most vile.

## Dullahan

Dark spirits taking the form of a person with naught a head on their shoulders, but grasped by the hair in one hand. It drives a black carriage, with wheels made of bones, and the wagon adorned with bleached skulls. The carriage is pulled by a team of jet black horses ![](media/3a32567d5cd7269f7e24f9a540df8e86.png)with burning embers in place of eyes. Witches are known to summon Dullahans to be both instruments of their foul magics and also their unholy lovers.

The Dullahan goes by many names, some call him The Dark Man, The Headless Horseman, or The Headless Rider. He is a harbinger of death and an evil fae who relentlessly seeks out his victim. He often wields weapons made out of his victims bones, usually a whip made out of the spines of his victims in one hand. And in the other he holds his own severed head. His head is said to have a terrible appearance, pale and covered in rotting flesh. His mouth is split into a terrifying grin as he finds joy in taking the lives of others and his eyes lit up with an evil fire constantly darting back and forth looking for their next victim.

The Dullahan is most often seen after sunset on festivals and days of feasting. But powerful witches can summon and bend them to their will. He does not speak save for the name of his victim. Once the Dullahan speaks your name, you are marked for death. Nothing can stop his command and there is no defying his call. Some even say you will go blind if his eyes lock with yours. There are rumors that the only thing that can stop them and make them flee is precious metals like gold, yet none have been foolish enough to try it and stand in their way.

*Run ye from the night black steed*

*Whose headless rider haunts the night*

*No power can his path impede*

*Nor long hide from his dead sight*

Fairies come in many forms, some are strikingly beautiful, others hideous. Some are spiritlike, with wings while others are oddly human in appearance. They are shape shifters who can assume whatever form pleases them, especially to deceive or manipulate people. In Hibernia they often assume the form of black birds.

Fairies homes are often in the earth and are accessed through mounds, caves, burrows, and holes in the ground. It is bad luck to disturb these places, and the fairies will take revenge on people who do, causing misfortune, illness, and even death. They travel in the physical world along paths, which, as with their homes, must never be disturbed or destroyed by humans. If someone builds a house atop a fairy track, the fairies will pass right through it, and the occupants will sicken, their crops will fail, and their animals will die. The fairies act as poltergeists, opening closed windows and doors and creating disturbances similarly to haunting ghosts. They amuse themselves with food, drink, music, and dancing. They attend human wakes and funerals eating the banquet food, spoiling it for people.

Fairies are elusive, and many prefer to keep to themselves. Using invisibility to remain hidden, they can make themselves visible to humans if they so desire. They are most often seen at twilight and dusk for those wishing to catch a glimpse of a fairy. Be warned though, fairies often punish those who look upon them by accident. With some folk saying, that the fairies may strike you blind if you see them when they are hidden. If they choose to be visible, fairies can bestow the gift of clairvoyance and healing upon mortals.

Fairies possess many abilities, with the most prevalent ones being, the ability to heal plants, animals and people, Speaking with animals as well as relying on them for protection, and the ability to make people lucky or unlucky. For those unlucky enough to anger a fairy, they have the ability to blight crops and health and can turn food bad. They possess the ability to use magic and bewitch people and may be convinced to teach mortals some of their magic in exchange for gifts or favors. Offerings to fairies are often left at “fairy haunts”, areas such as wells, fountains, forests, groves and other places. Those who are bewitched by a fairy are said to be “Fairy struck” and often appear to be in a trance, sickly, or act strange.

Fairies have a particularly nasty hatred of Pixies and will fly into a rage if confused for a pixie.

Gnomes are small benevolent spirits of the earth. In fact some scholars say they are physical representations of the Earth made manifest, carved from the earth itself, and that they are a type of Earth Elemental. Indeed their affinity with the earth and their earthly powers may lend some credence to this theory, but no one seems to know for certain one way or the other.

Typically seen as short old men wearing brightly colored clothes and pointy hats. They are elusive and very good at hiding from those they do not wish to see them. They most often live in caves and underground, but the rare few have been seen living in forests and gardens. Wherever a gnome calls home, plants and wildlife around will flourish. Regardless of where they live, the entrances to their homes are magically hidden and require either a gnome or something special and unknown to access it.

Gnomes are mysterious creatures with a unique culture just like humans. Commonly friendly and helpful towards humans, others are neutral or more mischievous and enjoy pranking them. Yet, the pranks they play are typically more playful than harmful like jumping out and scaring someone or telling them the wrong directions for entertainment only to guide them to the correct path once they’ve had their fill. They also enjoy pranking other fae and magical creatures.

Gnomes are nocturnal protectors of nature and are said to fiercely guard against any unnecessary damage to the earth and wildlife. They love jewelry and are excellent gem cutters and jewelers, as well as guardians of precious treasure hidden within mines. Friends of animals whom they are known to help in times of need. For they do not eat meat, living off of what nature provides except for alcohol. They love drinking alcohol, specifically raspberry mead, while sharing stories.

Despite their short stature, gnomes are incredibly strong and are many times stronger than humans. They are very fast as well and have better eyesight than that of a hawk. They can effortlessly manipulate and move through the earth freely.

Kelpies are shapeshifting vengeful evil spirits of water. Often appearing as black or white horses with dripping wet manes and initially appearing peaceful, even docile. They tempt travelers and lure them to their death, targeting the sick, tired, and injured. Most often luring their victims with promises of helping them cross dangerous waters or pretending to be hurt and injured while crying a dying wail. Only to draw in prey and drag them deep into the depths drowning and feasting upon them. Though the rare few are known to entice their victims through singing. Oftentimes their main goal is companionship, murder or both.

One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the Kelpie, is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse. Yet, they are surprisingly strong, being able to crush bone. Kelpies can shapeshift into a human form and look relatively indistinguishable from them, except for seaweed in their hair.

There are rumors that striking a suspected kelpie can make it regain its horse form and run away. Some say that stealing or grabbing hold of its bridle can grant you control over it. But not many have been brave enough or dumb enough to try and if they have, they haven't returned alive. Others believe that only a silver blade or bullet can truly kill them forever.

Stories of strange Kelpies, with a mane of serpents, persist throughout the Mystwood. As do other stranger and possibly friendlier or deadlier variations.

*If Kelpie gets you by its claws,*

*Light a torch don't touch its fur,*

*Don’t listen to its screeching cry*

*and never stare it in the eye.*

Leprechauns are solitary creatures who often appear sitting on a toadstool while working on a shoe in his lap. They wear a red or green coat with white breeches and black stockings and a tricorn or cocked hat perched upon their head. They are unique among the fae, for they are the only ones with a profession and are professional cobblers. While the other fae are dancing and reveling, the Leprechaun is hard at work. However their love of music and dance is well known as is their musical expertise.

Leprechauns usually live underground with hidden entrances, behind waterfalls or in the hollow trunk of fairy trees. They tend to avoid contact with mortals whom they see as foolish and greedy creatures. Many scholars say that, despite their lowly profession, Leprechauns are incredibly wealthy and are even guardians of treasure. Treasure hunters from all over attempt to find his treasure, with some even trying to capture and force the Leprechaun into giving them his wealth, only to be tricked and bested by his quick wit.

If caught by a mortal, he promises great wealth if allowed to go free. He carries two pouches with him that he uses to bribe himself out of situations. In one is a silver coin that magically returns to the purse once paid out. In the other is a golden coin that turns into ashes or leaves once the Leprechaun is set free. However, one must never take your eye off him, for he can vanish in an instant. Legend tells that if one were to capture a Leprechaun he would be granted 3 wishes.

“Rare is the tale of a person actually capturing a Leprechaun, and rarer still is the story of anyone succeeding in getting his fortune—for to take one’s eyes off the fellow for a split second inevitably leads to the sudden disappearance of both Leprechaun and treasure.” Catching a Leprechaun is no easy task, but they can be caught. However they are quick witted and equally as fast, easily outsmarting folk, and will vanish into thin air the moment you take your eyes off them. It is said you will be granted 3 wishes if you are lucky enough to catch one. But be careful, those who take advantage of the wishes have reaped ill fortune, madness and bitter regret.

It has been said that a Leprechaun may be invoked for financial aid, but how one would do so is unknown. If a person were to get on the good side of him or receive a favor from the Leprechaun, they may be gifted the “Leprechaun’s Shoes”. Magical shoes that disappear after a year and reappear with the Leprechaun to work on once more and to give out to another worthy folk.

A nocturnal creature known for his great love of drinking and a tendency to haunt breweries and wine cellars. He is almost always drunk and drinking, although they are typically good mannered. They party and create mayhem at night, playing pranks on people. Stealing or borrowing anything, raiding and feasting in the cellars of drunkards or scaring dishonest servants who steal the wine. However the clurichaun takes special care of the family to whom he has attached himself, endeavoring to protect their property and lives, provided he is not interfered with.

What the Clurichaun is exactly, no one knows. They may or may not be the same creature as the Leprechaun. If not, they are closely related. Some scholars believe they are a branch in the Leprechaun family tree and are Leprechauns lacking a work ethic who spend all their time drinking. Others believe the Clurichaun to be the nocturnal form of the Leprechaun, coming out at night to drink, party and play pranks on people after a hard day’s work.

The Clurichaun will protect your cellar from thieves and can allegedly prevent wine from spoiling and bottles from breaking or leaking. Simply request his presence and explicitly leave him alcohol and give him offerings on a regular basis lest he decide to begin serving himself.

He will occasionally offer alcohol to travelers. But if they do not pay or follow the Clurichauns “proper” drinking etiquette, which is often convoluted and bizarre, he will compel them to do his bidding until he is done with them. He often enjoys playing drinking games and getting players to figure out the rules of the game as they go.

Merrows, sometimes called “sea maids”, are shape-shifters that appear as reasonably gentle and beautiful mermaids, but on land may sprout legs and resemble humans. However, webbed fingers and emerald scales give them away. Merrows wear a special red hat called a “Cohuleen Druith” that distinguishes them from other mermaids. Which enables them to travel through the water. In order to come ashore, the merrow abandons and hides her cap. If they lose this cap, it is said that they will lose their power to return beneath the waves. Any mortal who finds their cap has power over her, as she cannot return to the sea until they are retrieved. Capture the hat and capture the Merrow. Legends tell of humans stealing their hat in order to marry the Merrow.

As with others of their kind, they sit on rocks, sing alluringly, and create distractions; hence, they are blamed for shipwrecks. Merrow-maidens have also been known to lure young men beneath the waves, where afterwards the men live in an enchanted state. Their exquisite singing can mean both harmonious joy or death to those who succumb to the melodic enchantment. They possess magical skill and knowledge, which they use on behalf of those humans they love or for whom they feel loyalty. Said to be affectionate and benevolent, the Merrow is known to develop attachments to human beings with stories of marriage existing and their descendants known to exhibit scaly skin, webbed fingers and oftentimes an affinity towards water.

Merrows are most often seen together singing and combing their hair. They enjoy gifts and offerings of flowers, candy, fruit and wine. They are often extremely wealthy with fortunes made up of gold from plundered shipwrecks. Scorned merrows have been known to hunt and drown victims, and angrily devour them, bones and all.

The Navarran lesser false unicorn is a rare nocturnal fae that travels in herds typically consisting of one stallion and multiple mares. They are known for being exceedingly swift and immune to almost all magic. They have an appearance somewhat similar to the popular conception of unicorns, but differ in several key ways. Firstly, they are generally much smaller than true unicorns. Secondly, while the mares do sport a single glowing horn, the stallions have two horns. Thirdly, and most strikingly is their call. They do not neigh or whiny but instead scream. Once one member of the herd begins to scream, the mares will attempt to flee while the stallions will seek to trample any threat. It is rumored that a mar separated from the herd can be pacified with cake and wine.

## Nixie/Nix or Nokk

Water spirits who love music and are often found near the banks of ponds and streams playing pipes. If charmed or flattered they can be convinced to teach bards and musicians. Rumors persist that they use their music to lure pretty young folk away from their families. ![](media/ace8eea877014ba846b333d44623cb2c.png)Some tales claim they take them and marry them, while others say they drown them and eat their flesh.

Nixes are the male counterpart of the female Nixies, sea spirits who may be generous or malicious as they choose. They love music and are brilliant musicians, who may be persuaded to teach bards and musicians in exchange for offerings. Most often being alcohol, hair ornaments and combs, or other gifts that intrigue them. Nixies love music and dancing and enjoy basking in the sun and combing their long hair. They are prophetic spirits and can be petitioned for information however they are temperamental and must always be addressed very politely and courteously lest their turn dangerous.

Nixie/Nix are mermaid-like shapeshifters who may walk on land whenever they wish, however their true identity is revealed by wet hair or clothes that never stop dripping. They live underwater in societies similar but drastically different from humans. Beautiful and irresistibly captivating, they are known to entice humans to their doom.

Rumors say that speaking their real name or dropping silver into their water can kill them. Though none of these stories tell of it being successful.

Do you hear the music playing?

Do you hear the water spraying?

Do you hear the sweetest song?

Do you wish to sing along?

*Ah, young maid, stay far away*

*When the Nokk asks you to play*

*He’ll pull you down into the stream*

*And not a one will hear you scream*

Pixies, also known as piskies, are mischievous and playful woodland tricksters that can be friendly or cause great harm depending on like or dislike. Much like a human child, they are curious and playful. Prone to misleading people, occasionally into traps, and hiding in flowers to scare folks. They enjoy dancing and their mostly harmless pranks. Luring people with mysterious dancing, charming, disembodied lights called pixie lights. To be pixie-led is to be led on a wild-goose chase, traveling in endless circles before collapsing in exhaustion and confusion, either following the lights or a pixie themself.

According to scholars, most Pixies live in barrows or stone rings, recently some folks have claimed to have seen them living in hollow trees or stumps. They are often seen near and associated with wells, hills, groves, springs, and rivers. Pixies can make nature fall under their spells. Plants grow quickly and more splendidly, and wild animals become tame. Pixies can also influence and charm the minds of mortals. Enchanting folks into joining their dance circles or travelers into following them and wandering for miles. Hordes of pixies sometimes fall upon lone travelers, forcing them to join in their dance until they drop from exhaustion.

Due to their capricious nature they are often blamed for things that aren't their fault. The sound of their giggling gives them away. However they don’t always like to be seen and their irrepressible giggling betrays their presence. In rare cases a pixie may lose or have their laugh stolen from them.

Pixies aren’t very good at making clothes and are most often seen wearing rags. But they love fine colorful clothing and jewelry and will seize any gift of beautiful clothing offered to them. Giving them beautiful clothing or jewelry is the best way to get them to stop their antics and on occasion can be used to get them to help travelers. However, once gifted clothing will run away happily. Often after being gifted clothes, Pixies will say “Pixie fine and Pixie gay, Pixie now will run away.” They enjoy pastries, alcohol and cream.

Pixies and fairies are often confused for one another. This almost always ends badly for the people who make this mistake. Both fairies and pixies hate being confused for the other and get very angry about it. Pixies and fairies are enemies. The most important distinction between them is that Fairies are often malicious, while Pixies are kind, with the occasional fit of mischief.

A puca (also pooka) is in Irish folklore, a spirit that is both helpful and mischievous. The puca has the helpful characteristics of the household BROWNIE and the mischievous characteristics of the Bogey and the bucca. The puca is a shape-shifter and is often seen in the form of a black animal or a black half-animal. When he is so inclined, he favours humans by enabling them to understand animal speech and by protecting them from evil spirits. If treated well, household pucas will clean up the house during the night and also do yard work. Ungrateful people invoke the puca’s wrath. He also bedevils grave robbers

No fairy is more feared in Ireland than the pooka. This may be because it is always out and about after nightfall, creating harm and mischief, and because it can assume a variety of terrifying forms.

The guise in which it most often appears, however, is that of a sleek, dark horse with sulphurous yellow eyes and a long wild mane. In this form, it roams large areas of countryside at night, tearing down fences and gates, scattering livestock in terror, trampling crops and generally doing damage around remote farms.

In remote areas of County Down, the pooka becomes a small, deformed goblin who demands a share of the crop at the end of the harvest: for this reason several strands, known as the 'pooka's share', are left behind

The mere sight of it may prevent hens laying their eggs or cows giving milk, and it is the curse of all late night travellers as it is known to swoop them up on to its back and then throw them into muddy ditches or bogholes. The pooka has the power of human speech, and it has been known to stop in front of certain houses and call out the names of those it wants to take upon its midnight dashes. If that person refuses, the pooka will vandalise their property because it is a very vindictive fairy.

A [red cap](https://mystwood.site/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=red_cap) is a fae creature of the Unseelie court. They come in many different sizes but are generally humanoids. Red caps are the scavengers of battlefields, skulking onto the field to dip their hats into the blood of the dead and dying. They revel in pain and mischief and should never be trusted. They are incredibly gullible however, and have an affinity for red objects and socks.

Gnome-like protectors of homes, friendly to welcomed guests, hostile to trespassers.. A single, cyclopean eye that glows at night. Masters of illusion, elusive. Have a poisonous bite (doom by poison). Seelie court

protectors of homestead and livestock, some believe they are a type of fae. They may take up residence in a well tended barn and quietly help with various tasks such as the mending of harnesses and sweeping of stalls. It is traditional to leave milk and bread or fruit out for them in thanks for their aid.

Spread the hay and tend the stalls

Wash the dishes and clean the halls

Share the milk and share the bread

So Tomte will help while we’re in bed

# Ghosts

Not truly undead, echoes of the memory of mortals who left unfinished business sometimes can be found lingering in the real world as spirits or ghosts. These pitiful beings often seek out the living, either to take out half-remembered frustrations, or for assistance in releasing them from the pattern of their pain.

Haunts?

Blue gloesticks

Torment

Compel you to feel my final moments

Laid to rest, some may dissipate and eventually reappear with times varying until they are laid to rest

# Goblinkind

There is some evidence that these types of humanoids collectively worship a "god" of sorts, the Moon made manifest, for much of their art depicts full and crescent moons and they are most active at night. If this god has a name, or is able to grant powers to its followers in the way the Three are, such information is largely unknown.

**The Cult of the Moon God**

Rumors tell that some goblins, orcs, ogres and the like serve a Moon God, probably a simple personification of the moon itself. Humans are rarely privy to the strange rituals of these nonhuman folk, which seem to differ from place to place and tribe to tribe. The few tenets agreed upon by most goblins are survival of the self and tribe, opposition to Chaos, and the importance of tradition.

No player character may begin the game worshiping the Moon God, but may discover means to do so in game. Further, characters who cease to worship the Three in favor of this nonhuman deity immediately lose the benefits of Miracles of Resurrection.

## Goblins

Common throughout Europa are green or grey-skinned goblins who move nomadically in tribes, stealing and slaying, living much like human bandits. Some count the goblins as fae, and this seems proven by their ability to twist way stones, using them to travel to and from their own lands. They are seldom a powerful force, and even small villages tend to be able to drive off goblins when they approach. In this way, they are much like giant rats- a nuisance, and part of life in the dark medieval.

These are the most common goblins, but much like humans there are many different types of goblins with their own cultures and behaviors. In addition to the goblins above these are some of the more well known variants.

Ice Goblins of Novgorond, Much like regular goblins Ice Goblins are small excitable creatures. Their skin color varies from grey to green to blue. Ice Goblins engage in trade with some and warfare in others. One thing they are known for is their skills in mining and metal working.

Meanwhile, in the area of Fenwyck and the northern portion of the Mystwood, the swamps are infested with quiet goblins of a much different disposition. These so-called "marshlings' ' are furtive, stealthy creatures, fond of robbery, but little prone to overt malice or ![](media/51031bde70a6255872a6abd5ba55df0c.png)murder- indeed, some of these goblins can be spoken to and traded with. Marshling goblins tend to favor the hit-and-run tactic, using bows and thrown weapons with great precision.

Goblins are dimwitted scavengers who rely on their numbers and dirty tricks. They can be vicious and quite numerous, but luckily are almost uniformly cowardly and can be easily driven away when in small numbers. However they can still come up with the occasionally clever trap, but are just as likely to set it off themselves. Much like overgrown and moderately clever rats, goblins usually live in squalid warrens and tunnels. Goblins are nomads and will also occasionally settle in caves and dense forests, or in structures abandoned by other creatures until it is time to move on. They are ruled by the strongest in the group. Strong creatures, such as Ogres & Trolls, are known to occasionally take control over a group of goblins after killing the previous leader. They are fond of junk and shinies and enjoy scavenging. They are also superstitious and treat magic and fire with both awe and fear.

The weakest goblins are usually either children, malnourished, or the runts of the goblins. They have been bullied most of their life and usually run from combat but can be made to fight from stronger creatures they serve out of fear. The strongest goblins are smart enough and strong enough to command and use tactics. They believe in their own strength enough to fight alone.

Weaker Goblins are often forced to do the worst duties and the regular goblins make up the backbone of the warriors and labor force. On occasion, Wolves and Dogs are also kept as guardians and beasts of war. The strongest Goblin or Creature in the tribe usually becomes the Chieftain alongside a goblin shaman and/or mage as a spiritual leader and advisor to the chief. The Goblin Monarch is the leader of all Goblin tribes and Chieftains in their territory. They are intelligent and command fealty from their subjects. It is not uncommon for Goblin Monarchs to be challenged by powerful Chieftains and creatures for their position.

| **Behaviors:**                    | You encourage the goblins and guide them spiritually during combat, typically using signs of nature or the like to lead them. Shamans provide backup to other goblins and rarely fight alone unless forced to, preferring to heal and damage from a distance.  |

Goblin Shamans are spiritual leaders and healers, they see and interpret omens in nature from their “god” of sorts, The moon made manifest. The weaker shamans are not very skilled and interpret most things as signs from their god when in fact they are not. While the stronger ones have a deeper connection with their god and become more useful as spiritual guides for the goblins in their tribe.

Groups of shamans (3 or more) are sometimes seen chanting together to create more potent effects. Though this is quite rare as there are typically only 1-2 shamans per tribe. Usually a Head shaman and their less experienced acolyte. This is because they are very territorial and Shamans will often backstab each other in order to protect their position, as well as the extra food and resources they receive as the Head spiritual leader and guide of the tribe. **- Check with GM’s or chronicle runners for potential effects.**

## Hobgoblins

The League (and thus, the Mystwood) is sometimes bothered by a breed of goblin which is, bizarrely, blue-skinned. These so-called "Hobgoblins" dress in strange garb reminiscent of the East, and chant in odd tongues. They do not appear to worship Chaos, at least not openly, but neither are they friends of man.

## Ogres

Ogres dwell nearly everywhere, in small numbers. Typically, ogres are brutish gray-skinned wretches, speaking the common tongue, but not much given to great thought. They live in families, which are often convoluted, in-bred affairs, and mutation is common- in fact, some scholars believe Ogres may be human in nature, but wholly transformed through some unknown mechanism. Some ogres raise pigs, bears, and other animals for meat, milk, and hides, and may even peacefully trade with humans. Although they are not protected by any law some villages choose to enter into very simple treaties with them, which often include an offering of food in return for protection. Many merchants keep ogres in their employ as bodyguards, but this can be risky, for when the merchant runs out of food to feed the ogre they may become their “bodyguard’s” next meal.

Most ogres, though, allow hunger to rule their lives, and are hard pressed to decide whether to greet a human or merely eat them. Some ogres are able to wield magic, and these beings are greatly feared. As with the other Goblinkind, they worship the Moon made manifest and are most active at night.

Ogre families are often prone to their usual infighting and at times an ogre might die because of it, but it typically does not bother the family for long. Ogres enjoy playing games, usually very violent ones. They are sometimes distrusting of humans but can be quite forgetful and ![](media/44ad8301369e3857d9c08b80ac156e78.png)might forget a previous encounter. They have some limited Cooking and Brewing skills being able to make Nail Soup, Toxic Food and brewing disgusting but effective alcohol and other gross concoctions.

| **Behaviors:**                    | Ogres are brutish lumbering creatures that speak slowly with poor grammar. They typically have an intelligence that varies from being dumb to that of a human child. They are driven by hunger and may trade with humans but are more likely to just eat them.

| **Naming Conventions:**           | Ogres typically have short guttural sounding names such as (Worug, Glurg, Og, Etc.) but often refer to others in their family by their relation to them (Father, Mother, Sibling, Brother, Etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Ogre Mutations** - *All mutations come with an advantage and disadvantage and must be displayed clearly through costuming and behaviors.*

**Club Foot** - A mutation on your foot has made it difficult for you to walk, you are slow and limp, but cannot be rooted.

**Hunchback** - You have developed a large impervious hump on your back but have a compromised immune system. Weapon attacks that strike the back have no effect and you lose 4 HP from starting stats.

**Maimed arm** - One of your arms has become so mutated that it cannot be used, but the other arm is now much stronger and does increased base damage from your starting stats: None-\>Work Rhythm-\>2 Crushing-\>4 Crushing

**Patches of scales** - A deformity in your blood has caused scales to grow all over your body. You gain an Extra 2 HP but are horribly itchy due to the discomfort and must itch yourself frequently.

**Claws** - Your hands have deformed and turned into large claw-like appendages. You lose the ability to wield weapons and use any crushing attacks, but gain endless maim special attacks.

## Orcs

In the beginning before the years knew numbers and the lands knew names there was nothing but an endless wilderness. Every tree and creature was touched with enchantment and the world as a child discovering how to walk, under the endless wheel of the sun and moon. Out of the sun dappled shadows between trees came the first wild elves, they were wise and patient and understood the language of the world. From the stones of mountains rose the Duergar, they were stout and crafty and shaped the bones of the earth with only their hands. From the tusks and hides of beasts awoke the Orcs. They were strong and honorable, they soothed the savage creatures and fostered the timid.

The Children of the Dawning World came to each other and made a pact. They would respect the world that bore them and make it a place for themselves to live in harmony with it. The elves gave their great tower to always keep watch, the dwarves gave their silver golems to tend and shape the land, and the orcs gave a relic of their heritage to promise service eternally. So the three people brought the world to a harmonious form, and for what was to be eternity the sun and moon watched and turned always overhead. The changing of the world followed the quicklings, the humans. They named their Gods, marked their borders, and numbered their years. Their Justice was domination. Their Wild was exploitation. And their Mercy was slaughter. They broke the branches of the ageless trees and drowned the soil and rivers in blood. They brought with them time and in their wake ages flowed forward and the eternal cycle drifted towards entropy.

The final insult of the quicklings was their Elf Slayer. His crusade would not end until he had purged the world of the people of the forest. Sensing the end the elves willed to live no longer in this world of horrors. The Duerger returned to their mountain homes. The Orcs became lost and savage. Thus ends the eternal age, and begins the counted years.

*Hear the drums that call the horde*

*Hear the howling of the wargs*

*See their torches in the night*

*See them dance in firelight*

*Star and Moon upon their shields*

*Blood and gore soaked battlefields*

*Enemies of Elves and Men*

*Monsters to the bitter end*

Much feared but rarely seen of late, the powerful Orcs of the Gray Mountains were once a plague on both Burgundy and Navarre. With underground strongholds and mines boring deep into the stone from their base in Mt. Draka, these orcs are slavers and murderers of great cunning and skill. The Duergar of the Gray Mountains, never friends of the orcs, have long battled with them for control of precious metals and other resources. The orcs of the Gray Mountains are much devoted to the worship of Chaos, often going painted with the Star of Discord and prone to berserk rages. There are orcs who live with virtue and honor, however, and care must be taken to determine the nature of any orc group that is met.

Some scholars believe every once in a while, a goblin of great malice will undergo a change, possibly a form of Chaos mutation. These wretches become Orcs, losing much of their mind in exchange for brutal power. Others point to Ogre families who dwell near humans, and blame orcs on the wicked by-blows of their commerce. Still others think, quite oddly, that orcs can be bred in huge vats out of meat, wood, and cast off magic. There are few who know the truth, if there is but one truth to be had.

Orc tribes are almost universally warlike and savage. Their shields and banners are often painted with images of stars or the moon, whether this is homage to Chaos or something else is uncertain. Of their history little is known. A few old relics suggest that they once fought with the elves, though whether against them or alongside them against some unknown foe is lost to time.

Some say the code of Orcish clans is *Blood, Battle, and Victory*. Others believe the code of the Orcish clans to be *Blood, Honor, and Strength.* Yet no one knows for certain as it has been lost to time and tribal schism.

## Troll

Far more wicked than Ogres are Trolls. These beings usually live alone, often under bridges or near water. Most are gray or green skinned, often having long arms, tails, massive teeth, humps, or any of a dozen other foul features. Trolls, more often than not, cannot speak, and instead exist in states of joyful slaughter, moving from creature to creature, reveling in the pain they can cause. Some few, with low cunning, are hired as mercenaries by the truly wicked or desperate.

Trolls are known to often set up on roads or bridges outside of small towns trying to collect tolls in food, crown or other shiny items of value. These tolls are usually overpriced but, if they are paid, travelers can mostly assume a safe trip across.

# Knights of Chaos

The most powerful of Chaos’ mortal servants are the so-called Chaos Knights. Clad in strange armor and capable of great feats of evil, the might of a Chaos Knight is as much or more the product of the armor- always powerful artifacts of magic- as it is the wearer. Indeed, many Chaos Knights are often known and described more by their harness and heraldry than their own personalities. For example, the mighty Stormbringer armor, which plagued the Mystwood Keep for many years, was worn by no less than four mortal beings in the course of a decade, its own daemonic personality usurping and controlling the mortal within. The armor of Chaos Knights is notoriously difficult to destroy, and can regenerate from even small pieces. Invariably, such mortal lords of Chaos attract followings of evil beings- cultists, daemons, and worse.

# Mutants

Some whose flesh is marred by Chaos bear extreme changes- hands mutated into claws or tentacles, backs covered in sharp spikes, large horns, additional eyes, and the like. These are called Mutants. Proximity to corrupted places, beings, magic, and the like seems to cause mutation through little-understood ways. Mutation is most common at birth, but can occur later in life as well.

Most mutants can speak, and will at times trade or negotiate with ordinary folk. The Church teaches that they are to be pitied and showed charity and mercy, so long as they did nothing willfully to bring on their state. Alas, many mutants are loyal to the forces of Chaos. Those who are not are superstitiously said to bring misfortune, ill luck, and further mutation with them, and thus are sometimes driven out into the wilderness. Despite the teachings of the Church, many lords order the killing of mutants in their lands out of hand.

While common mutants may be pitied, there are greater creatures that must be feared. Chaos may work a greater transformation in powerful Gifted individuals, one fitting to the vice that lured them into darkness. Their flesh and spirit are transformed, and they become Chimera. These beings are the monsters of legend- Medusae spawned by Vanity, Draconians of Greed, Gorgons of Rage, plague-bearing Harpies, and many more.

Mutation can touch animals as well as humans, and it is so that Beastmen are created. Beastmen most often have the heads of beasts, but the form of men. Minotaurs are the greatest of their kind, but nearly any animal can be so changed. Beastmen have enough intelligence to make use of weapons and occasional scraps of armor and clothing, but can rarely speak more than a few words of the common tongue. Universally they are savage servants of Chaos, with a great hatred of humankind.

#### **Chaos and Mutation**

Chaos has a lingering presence everywhere, and sometimes a child is born changed. As commonly, adults are transformed by contact with Chaos- sometimes deliberate, sometimes chance fate. Those who take up Chaos Marks willingly are criminals and imperil their souls, while those who are changed by accidents or malice are pitied.

**Example Costuming:** Discolored skin, patches of scales or slime, asymmetrical horns or tusks. A mutation like an animal’s head or a tentacle arm is too extreme to be allowed as the sign of Chaos for a player character, for such a person would not be allowed inside town walls.

**Common Advantages:** Advantageous Gluttony, Call of Freedom, Caustic Blood, Durability, Elemental Fury, Evil Eye, Natural Armor, Poison Spittle, Skin Changer, Witchblood

**Common Disadvantages:** Bloodlust, Carouser, Cowardice, Divine Disfavor, Eternal Foe: Chaos, Excessive Curiosity, Forgetful, Greed, Gullible, Horribly Disfigured, Mostly Illiterate, Raging Hunger, Sickly, Slow, Tainted, Troublemaker, Unwashed, Vulnerability

| **Behaviors:**                    | They are somewhat feral and not particularly clever. They want blood and slaughter and meat. They will eat any meat they can get their hands on - animal, human, rotten. They will shout things like "blood blood blood!", "for the Sisters!" "Slaughter!"                                                                           |
| **Naming Conventions:**           | Beastmen tend not to give much thought to names. Many in fact do not have them. Such names as they do take are often deed names or derived from the kind of animal they most resemble- Ripper, Flayer of Flesh, Broken Horn, Bull, Ram and the like. Some of the more clever ones may imitate the names of humans, but this is rare. |

Beastfolk are, ultimately, the result of Chaotic mutation, like so many other dangers that plague mankind. Where mighty daemons of Chaos go, the land warps and breaks around them, becoming fouled by their very presence. In these places, the beasts become tainted, growing malignly intelligent, their mutations often giving them the semblance of hands.

These transformed beasts breed more of their fouled kin, and in only a few generations, breeding quickly as their forebears do, such beastmen can become the dominant species in an area. For reasons related to the typical domestic stock of villages, most beastfolk in civilized areas come from goat or dog stock, while deer, wolf, and hawks form the typical beastfolk root species in wild places. All beastfolk have a vague and instinctual understanding of their origin, and so are willing accomplices of Chaotic cults and daemonkind.

No matter their origin animal, beastfolk subsist primarily on meat, preferring the flesh of humans over all other. They tend to be stupid and crude but have enough intelligence to make use of weapons and occasional scraps of armor and clothing, but can rarely speak more than a few words of the common tongue. Universally they are savage servants of Chaos and the Sisters of Slaughter, with a great hatred of humankind, interested only in food, weapons, and slaughter. Sadly for the friends of humankind, some few beastfolk feature mutations which allow for great cunning, even to the point of sorcerous capability. Such beastfolk relish the opportunity to corrupt humans, pretending to be skin changers or blessed followers of the Wild.

They are nomadic and follow a ruling Beastlord, they sometimes set up temporary campsites near herdstones and attack nearby settlements.

| **Naming Conventions:**           | Beastmen tend not to give much thought to names. Many in fact do not have them. Such names as they do take are often deed names or derived from the kind of animal they most resemble- Ripper, Flayer of Flesh, Broken Horn, Bull, Ram and the like. Some of the more clever ones may imitate the names of humans, but this is rare. |

## Cyclops

Cyclopes are savage, brutal creatures who are often enslaved and used to shock troops by Grithean Legionnaires. Driven by rage and pain, they will exterminate anyone they encounter on the battlefield. More rarely, they can be found free in the wild, where they attack ![](media/2c0efd7f2f8ae8c1a4edab1186a7094f.png)virtually anything they encounter.

| **Behaviors:**                    | Brutish and violent, you communicate in a series of grunts and roars.

You will fight brutally but not tactically, counting on your strength to see you through. You are also not at all bright, and can be tricked into attacking your Grithean masters. |

## Minotaur![](media/8ac6824b47242af3a5bfacd6966b8ee8.png)

Beastmen are created from chaos that corrupted the animals and beast of the land. Beastmen most often have the heads of beasts, but the form of men. Minotaurs are the greatest of their kind, but nearly any animal can be so changed.

# Near-Humans- Duergar, Elvenkind, and Shapeshifters

There are beings in Europa who are not dissimilar to humans, but who have their own cultures, technologies, traditions, and the like. The most common of these are Shapeshifters such as seablooded, werewolves, werebears, and the like. These creatures normally live in small savage, camps in the wilderness, spending time in the shape of both man and beast as suits them. Shapeshifters were driven to the outskirts of society by the Romans, and are little trusted due to their crude manners and violence.

Duergar, on the other hand, are often welcome in human society, though they tend to dwell in their own villages and mines. These so called “Mountain Fathers” or “Dwarves” are master smiths, miners, and warriors, who keep their own counsel, and live, work, and worship in their own quiet way. The Duergar do little to meddle in the affairs of humanity, though they can be ferocious enemies when their rage is risen.

Lastly, long ago in Europa there was a race of human-like beings who were masters of magic and civilization. Said to be kin to Fae and mortal alike, the majority of the Elves died out, or disappeared, long before even the time of Rome. Though rare interactions with beings who seem to act and appear as Elves, and even call themselves such, do still occur, it is assumed that most modern “Elves” are the mostly-human descendants of such beings, or of Fae-mortal liaisons.

## 

## Duergar

In the beginning before the years knew numbers and the lands knew names there was nothing but an endless wilderness. Every tree and creature was touched with enchantment and the world as a child discovering how to walk, under the endless wheel of the sun and moon. Out of the sun dappled shadows between trees came the first wild elves, they were wise and patient and understood the language of the world. From the stones of mountains rose the Duergar, they were stout and crafty and shaped the bones of the earth with only their hands. From the tusks and hides of beasts awoke the Orcs. They were strong and honorable, they soothed the savage creatures and fostered the timid.

The Children of the Dawning World came to each other and made a pact. They would respect the world that bore them and make it a place for themselves to live in harmony with it. The elves gave their great tower to always keep watch, the dwarves gave their silver golems to tend and shape the land, and the orcs gave a relic of their heritage to promise service eternally. So the three people brought the world to a harmonious form, and for what was to be eternity the sun and moon watched and turned always overhead. The changing of the world followed the quicklings, the humans. They named their Gods, marked their borders, and numbered their years. Their Justice was domination. Their Wild was exploitation. And their Mercy was slaughter. They broke the branches of the ageless trees and drowned the soil and rivers in blood. They brought with them time and in their wake ages flowed forward and the eternal cycle drifted towards entropy.

The final insult of the quicklings was their Elf Slayer. His crusade would not end until he had purged the world of the people of the forest. Sensing the end the elves willed to live no longer in this world of horrors. The Duerger returned to their mountain homes. The Orcs became lost and savage. Thus ends the eternal age, and begins the counted years.

In the current age Duergar are often welcome in human society, though they tend to dwell in their own villages and mines. These so-called “Mountain Fathers” or “Dwarves” are master smiths, miners, and warriors, who keep their own counsel, and live, work, and worship in their own quiet way. Long ago, it is said they imparted their knowledge of engineering unto the Romans. The Duergar do little to meddle in the affairs of humanity, though they can be ferocious enemies when their rage is risen. The Duergar of the Gray Mountains, never friends of the orcs, have long battled with them for control of precious metals and other resources.

## Serpentfolk

Wholly unrelated to the beastfolk and ratfolk are the ancient race of the serpent, or lizard people. In turns wise and brutal, some sages state that long before the first tribes of humankind, the serpentfolk had a mighty and powerful civilization, centered on the island which Plato called Atlantis. In some ancient tales, the serpentfolk assisted the rise of man, and were friends of humanity. In others, however, they were violent and monstrous, sacrificing humans by the score upon evil altars. Regardless, the great empire they are purported to have has fallen far, and now most serpentfolk dwell in primitive bands. Many are unable to speak the language of man, communicating amongst themselves in hisses and growls. They tend to dwell in rough huts or caves, or amongst the ruins of their ancestors. While their physical culture uses stone weapons, or scavenged works of metal, spiritually the serpentfolk have a complicated religious life, interacting with their ancestors and with their own god-like entities through a caste of shamans and priests. Some appear to worship the Three, especially strange versions of Justice and the Wild. Serpentfolk appear to find Chaos repellent, and the majority of tribes actively war against the servants of Chaos, a major contributor to the downfall of their culture. What few tribes that have fallen sway to Chaos are considered outcasts from serpentfolk society, and open states of war often exist between tribes.

## Nattamara

Shapeshifters, usually female, that take the form of bipedal wolves and attack livestock. Cattle that they have attacked will often show bites and cuts where the Nattamara have drained them of blood. Unlike other stories of werewolves, they do not seem to be tied to the cycles of the moon. Instead they seem more tied to the cycles of the seasons, attacking during the harvest times.

# Near-Animals- Chimera, Dire Animals, Great Rats, and White Beasts

There are many types of nearly natural animals that dwell in Europa. The most common are Dire Animals, which are sometimes mistaken for Beastmen. They are larger, more humanoid, more aggressive versions of natural creatures. These are understood to be free from the taint of Chaos. Boar, bear, and deer are all common dire beasts. Dire Animals are distinct from ordinary creatures in that they are played by NPCs. Unlike beastmen, they are edible. They are prized as game, and some are illegal to hunt without the permission of a noble, though it is generally allowed to kill them in self-defense.

Chimera are strange beasts possessing the traits of two or more animals. Many of the famous creatures of antiquity- griffins, manticores, pegasi, and the like- were chimeric in nature. It is believed that many are the results of Chaotic influence, for the armies of Teutonia and the Danes sometimes make use of chimeric creatures, even sometimes creating Beastmen of them.

Whether Chaos is a part of their ancestry or not, chimera tend to be quick tempered and capable of great violence, and are best left alone in the hidden places where they dwell.

Great Rats are bipedal, speaking creatures who may be the descendants of beastmen or dire beasts, or something unique to themselves. They often mimic portions of human society, with amusing or dangerous results. Thieves and scavengers, most places in Europa count them as vermin, and pay well to have them eradicated.

Lastly, White Beasts are generally typical representations of their animal or dire animal species, but are possessed of intelligence and wisdom far surpassing others of their kind. They are said to be sacred to the Lord of the Wild, and the hunting or harming of them is forbidden in many lands, despite the valuable magical properties their flesh and blood are rumored to possess.

The honey, wax and comb produced by giant bees is coveted by many. Honey, wax,

comb, and even bee poison all have their uses that many attempt to gather. Some

capture Queen bees and make hives of their own to farm. But for those wishing

to collect their resources or capture them, they have a dangerous task ahead of them.

Bees are very territorial and will attack any that get too close. They have deadly

poisonous attacks and should be approached with caution.

## Jellyfish

Different from normal Jellyfish by their ability to leave the water, these creatures can float effortlessly in the air. They are nearly mindless, generally attacking only when startled or threatened. There are two types of Jellyfish thus far, regular (or Small) Jellyfish, and Man O' Wars.

## Ratfolk

The ratfolk of Europa come in many shapes, sizes, and capabilities. Some are powerful magicians, while most are primitive and foolish. They are quarrelsome and rude, generally squabbling amongst themselves over scraps and shiny things. It is assumed that, ultimately, Ratfolk are a type of Beastfolk, ultimately created from the interaction of Chaos and reality. However, they have progressed beyond this, possessing their own society consisting primarily of warrens Whether intelligent and educated, or savage scavengers, ratfolk are plentiful and dangerous. For the most part, they survive in human ruins, stealing nearly everything they possess. In some places, they work with local humans, dwelling in cellars, sewers, trash yards and the like, becoming a real danger only when they, inevitably, become overpopulated. In most places, however, they are a nuisance at the least, and marauders at worst. Some ratfolk, however, do overcome their origins. It is believed that they are capable of “domestication”, and white ratfolk have been born which seem to be at least acknowledged by the Wild. Perhaps one of the most famous of these ratfolk is called “Coldnose”, and dwells in the environs of the Mystwood Keep.

Lastly, there are the Undead. While most dead sleep, and dream of the promised future of the gods, a spirit might be awakened from its rest, sometimes due to its own pain, suffering and unfinished business, but more often through the foul magics of necromancy. With or without their bodies, they walk among the living in many forms- zombies, skeletons, haunts, wights, revenants, ghouls, and more. The source of necromancy is the greatest of the Undead- Vampires. True Vampires have betrayed the three gods and have been damned for it. They are able to create other, lesser vampires, who in turn can do the same, until thin vampire blood flows through the veins of many mortals.

**UNDEAD**

Undead Trait: “Detect Eternal Foe Undead” at will. Take full effect from anything delivered with "to Undead". Call No Effect to “by Will”, "by Poison", Lethal, or Doom.

Guidelines: Undead tend to be high hit points, high durability monsters. Their attacks often use “By Will” effects. Undead were once human and can have some pathos and human emotion, ultimately they are mostly tragic figures.

There can be no mistake that the various evils responsible for the foul cruelty of robbing a body or soul of its rightful and holy rest are to be utterly and wholly reviled by all goodly folk across every realm and every populace of the world. The wrongness of their state drives most undead completely mad and fills their remains, whether body, spirit, or some combination of the two, with a malign hatred of the living. Expect them to attack on sight and it is your rightful duty to return these creatures to their proper place in the cycle of life granted to all living things by the Three. This morality is beyond question; all undead suffer. You do them a kindness with your efforts.

There are as many types of undead as there are headstones in a graveyard and it is important to quickly determine the physical aspects of the particular foe you are facing. The most common clawing and crawling undead are skeletal or zombified corpses. These rarely have any whim in their empty bodies except the will of the master that created them. Destroying their bodies with axes and maces or fire is sufficient and one need not have a great fear of facing them unless outnumbered. Do not bother to use your lethal strikes with sword or spear as these weapons kill by exsanguination or organ destruction and these creatures are far beyond such worries. Take care for undead mages that may use the earth they once rested in to grasp limbs or otherwise hinder a brave warrior. Similarly, some undead have shown the ability to burst forth from the ground, causing the confused defenders to drop weapons and be flung away. Normal ranks of shields and weapons are useless in these cases and great care must be taken to space apart so that many soldiers are not affected at once.

There exists also undeath that only drags the spirit back, subverting it from its proper destination. Often these spirits retain memories or mannerisms that they had in life. Do not be fooled by outward displays of anguish or think they are worthy of sympathy to prolong their existence. Such is the strength of self preservation instinct that they may fail to see properly and determine that your attempts to destroy their tortured existence is an attack against them personally. These spirits may be completely immune to weapons of every type and it may be for you to withdraw and bring a passionate companion and priest. Expect fear and confusion and torment as these unfortunate souls retaliate against your good work.

Finally, there are those undead that retain body and spirit with the weaknesses and strengths of both in some capacity as listed above. Engage these monsters with extreme care and remain adaptable for there exists no surefire way to battle them but unwavering faith in the Three. Mercy herself demands their torture ends, Justice must see the wrong of their creation righted, and the Wild will not suffer the existence of walking death.

In all cases treat the destroyed undead with the respect you would give any who have passed and consecrate the place they haunted to be certain no lingering darkness remains to animate another hapless soul.

In closing, recognize that some undead are beyond your ability to destroy with a weapon or spell. In these cases withdraw and notify your local magistrate of the need for a specialist. A Witchhunter may be required to investigate.

## Barrow-Wight

Barrow-Wights are only raised by the most powerful necromancers and vampires. They are harvested from the burial mounds of lords and kings old. Barrow-Wights are particularly evil and angry spirits.

They sometimes act as spies and messengers among humankind for the Undead. Ghouls use claws and ghasts spit – the most powerful of their kind will combine both abilities.

| **Other Notes:**   | Normal Animal stats until killed then they rise up as plague animals and use the stats here. If they drop an opponent, they will afflict them with “swift Rot”. If killed while a zombie they go into horrible spasms for a minute then shout “By my voice, three damage by poison”. This does NOT happen if they are purified correctly. May have other abilities depending on the animal type. \*\*\*Base "2 Damage by Poison" |

## Vittra

Dwellers under the earth. They usually keep to themselves and are very rarely seen. Where they dwell, plant growth is more vibrant. It is Very Bad luck to build your dwelling on top of theirs, the entrances to which are often marked with Beech or Hawthorne trees or large burmes. Guess where they just built the new privy?

*Down below down below*

*The Vittra they live down below*

*So have a care whene’er you go*

*And mind the Vittra down below!*

## Huldra

Forest dwellers, they are generally peaceful unless disturbed. They appear largely human, but have the tails of either cows or foxes and a large opening in their backs revealing that their torsos are hollow trees. They usually hide these characteristics, and may become enraged or insulted if these are pointed out.

*Don’t tell the Huldra she’s got a tail!*

*If she gets mad she’ll spoil the ale!*

*If you see a maid with a hole in her back*

*It’s rude to point or tell what she lacks*

*Just be polite and say good day*

*She’ll do the same and be on her way*

## Solfanger

A mysterious spirit inhabiting the March of Luceval. It only appears after the sun has retreated from the sky, and is never seen alone. The cries of many spirits of those long passed, follow in its wake. Rumors persist that it steals the souls of dead and dying men. As such, it is most likely to be seen at the sites of great bloodshed. Many of the superstitious provide offerings of amaranth flowers to keep Solfanger away when a loved one is close to dying.

The followers of the god of the Wild native to Luceval, claim the spirit is enacting the will of the Keeper of the Dead. That it is collecting the souls of those unable to rest peacefully, whether it’s the unburied, or those with unfinished business. The spirit actively seeks out the undead and is known to travel into villages and hamlets when the dead begin to rise. Regardless of why the spirit is near, its sighting is a bad omen. A sign of imminent death, or undeath.

*Brave soldier brave soldier*

*Fallen fallen in your final fight*

*But alas alas*

*Worthless now is all your might*

*For no God smiles*

*Upon your final plight*

*The stars the stars*

*Gaze upon your soul so bright*

*Solfanger Solfanger*

*Now it comes to claim your light*

*What is and was now must fade*

*And be lost unto the dark of night*

[Myrmidons](https://mystwood.site/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=myrmidon) are bipedal, insect-like beings hailing from deep below the earth of the Known World. A race of legend, Myrmidons re-entered modern history in 966 when they were utilized by the Daemon, Grom'Gatch the Darkbringer, to lay siege to the town of Burgundar in the Daemon's machinations to claim the town's holy relics for his own.

Novgorond Wiki Info

**THE BESTIARY OF NOVGOROND**

Strigoi - The Strigoi are bestial vampyres, they are known for their strength and ferociousness. Many have the ability to transform into great dire wolves or enormous bats, and some may even pass between mortals invisible to the naked eye. Their primary sustenance is blood, and human blood is what they covet most.

Yehtis - Yehtis can be found in the more mountainous regions of Novgorond. They are tall lanky creatures that fight with a combination of long claws and ice weapons. They cannot speak the common tongue, but seem to have their own customs and culture. They hunt in packs and rarely discern the difference between animals and human kind, stalking each of them as opportunities arise.

Polar Bears, Ice Wolves, Sabercats - Most wild animals found in the League of Novgorond are large, dangerous predators. Polar Bears and Saber Cats tend to be solitary creatures hunting and killing to survive the long winters. Ice Wolves, on the other hand, travel in large packs and are known for their agility. These animals may be hunted, but some villages choose to leave them be in hopes that they will act as a defense against wandering marauders from the other side of the wall.

Lycanthropes - Lycanthropes are often confused with Ice Wolves and Dire Wolves but are in fact much different. A Lycanthrope is a human that transforms into a supernatural wolf once a month who wreaks havoc on nearby farms and villages. Some Lycanthropes live among humans and take special precautions to prevent their transformation while others live in small communities in the forest stalking and stealing from other humans to survive.

Fairy Folk aka Fae - Fae are perceived based on mortals imagination and the folk lore they were brought up with. In ancient Greece the Fae would have appeared as Satyrs, Nymphs, Centaurs, and other small mythological creatures. In Burgundar Fae take the form of Dark Elves which are common in viking legends. In Novgorond notable fairy folk include: Baba Yaga, Rusalka, Leshy, Koschei, Vodyanoy, Lady Midday, and the snow pixies.

Baba Yaga often appears as an elderly women, and can be found deep within the darkest parts of the woods. Baba Yaga may assist you in your quest, sharing her immeasurable wisdom, or she may poison you with a cup of tea and feast upon your flesh.

The Rusalka is a being most commonly found near a body of water. She stands for fertility and protects the nature around her. Though Resulka’s are not inherently evil they often resent mortal kind for the harm they inflict upon nature.

A Leshy is a forest spirit often having the appearance of a tree. Some villages claim that Leshy are evil, stealing their children in the night for their own amusement, but other villages are known to consider the Leshy guardians.

The Koschei is an immortal fairy known for stealing brides on their wedding night, seducing the would be brides with kind words, false promises and physical attraction. It is unknown whether there is only one Fae named Koschei of if there are many, but in any case no more than one has ever been seen at a time.

The Vodyanoy is said to appear as a naked old man with a frog-like face, greenish beard, and long hair, with his body covered in muck, usually covered in black fish scales. He has webbed paws instead of hands, a fish's tail, and eyes that burn like red-hot coals. He usually rides along his river on a half-sunk log, making loud splashes. Local drownings are said to be the work of the vodyanoy. In their underwater world the Vodyanoy are subjects of the Vodyan Tsar who lives in the clouds and has the power to create rivers and lakes.

Lady Midday appears only during the warmest part of the day. In the summer she is violent and feared, causing burns on the necks and backs of workmen and deadly exhaustion. During the winter however she is welcomed and more pleasant in temperament, she brings warmth to the day. She can appear as a young woman, a grizald hag, or even a young child. Many speculate what causes these differences in appearance, but none truly know.

Snow Pixies are some of the most pleasant fairy folk in the area, they are kind, easily excited and enjoy building snowmen and engaging in snowball fights. Their joy can sometimes grate against the stone faced defenders of the wall and haggard villagers who know death is likely near, but the children seem to adore them.

Courting the Fae - Due to the violent untamed nature of the area around the Wall the fae are especially powerful. The best way for an outpost or rural village to protect themselves from the multitude of fae is to ally with one and grant them the place as their territory. Each year the outpost must select a different fae, meet their demands and receive their boon and protection.
