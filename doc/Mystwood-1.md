# AN INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD OF MYSTWOOD

Mystwood is a LARP (Live Action Role Playing) Game of heroic adventure, set in a fantastical version of medieval Europe. The World of Mystwood is not entirely unlike our own- so similar, in fact, that it makes the differences all the more obvious. Like our own Middle Ages in Europe, Mystwood’s Europa is plagued by wars of religion, the intrigues of noble houses, and the slow rise of a mercantile class. Unlike the real world, however, to Mystwood we add the fantastic and the horrific to the already rich tapestry of history.

Pulling inspiration from times and cultures between 800 and 1500 AD, the folktales and mythology of the people and places of those times, and modern fantasy games, we create a world of magic, intrigue, and danger. A world of loosely knit feudal kingdoms, where magic lies forgotten in forlorn places, waiting to be sought out by the brave. Where the glory that was Rome lies just beneath the surface, buried centuries ago by the actions of the Dragon and its kin. Where the Three Gods silently watch the lives of their faithful, sending Saints to return to life, that they might help guide humanity toward a brighter future.

At Mystwood, adventurers face the ever-present threat of Chaos, whose forces strive impatiently to sweep the lands of mankind under a tide of daemons, mad cultists, horror and death. They match swords and wits with the looming specter of Undeath, ever aware that those who stand against the darkness must fear for the peace of their graves. And they thwart the machinations of the courts of the Fae, who are at times fickle friends of mankind, and at others bitter and unpredictable foes. Countless monsters of all shape and description, drawn from real world myths and the fevered minds of the game staff, stalk the quiet places between the lonely towns and villages of Europa, waiting for an easy meal of hapless travelers. And, perhaps worse, even amongst the “civilized” bastions of humanity, there dwell folk who would tear all asunder for power, for wealth, or for glory.

# CHAPTERS
There are in-lore locations where the game takes place, these are called Chapters. The chapters are named after the locations where they take place. Additional lore books for these chapters are available in dedicated documents. The game currently takes place in the year 974.

These locations are the original locations (Mystwood version 1) with stories taking place between the years 960 and 974. 
- **The Keep**: The Mystwood Chapter of The Keep takes place at the walled city of The Keep and the surrounding lands of Hibernia.
- **Burgundar**: The Mystwood Chapter of Burgundar takes place at the Town of Burgundar and the surrounding area.
- **Novgorond**: The Mystwood Chapter of Novgorond takes place at the forever cold and snowy Town of Novgorond and the surrounding lands.

# A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EUROPA

Most readers will notice many similarities between Historical Europe and the Europa of Mystwood, but it would be a mistake to assume too much. Mystwood is a place interwoven with Magic and the threat of Chaos, with its own past, religion and culture. Though we have used some of the history of Europe, and elements of its history and culture between 800 and 1500 AD (roughly 1300 for most places) to build Mystwood and to give players a reference point to help them understand the world they will inhabit, we have not followed it strictly, and while some historical figures, names, and place names are similar or identical, they may be used in wildly different ways. As the wise say, “Expect only what occurs”.

# HISTORY
Legends tell that, long before recorded history, mankind dwelled in thrall to mighty powers- strange and mercurial gods, capricious fae, murderous undead, and worst, the corrosive presence of Chaos, tainting and destroying all it touched. The great Forest lay thick across the world, making travel dangerous. Monsters ruled the dark places beneath the canopy, and people lived fearfully in small groups.

Over thousands of years, cultures long forgotten discovered iron, created writing and mathematics, mastered the power of the elements, and tamed the mysteries of the world to create magic spells. Rumors and legends whisper the names of those dead and forgotten lands- Atlantis, Assyria, Carthage, Egypt, Sumer, Tartassus, Troy, but few who yet live know more than the mere names of these lands.

The oldest empire that most can describe with any certainty is the great Empire of the Romans, their descendants still lingering on in small enclaves and on the edge of Europa in Byzantium, City of Wonders. Brave Imperial soldiers drove back the Beastmen and other denizens of the forests and built roads, wall, forts and towns. Roman priests came together with others to form the Faith of the Three. Many of the great cities of Europa were built and prospered under Rome, including the three great capitals of the Empire- Rome, Byzantium, and Aquila.

Of these mighty cities, the greatest was the city of Aquila, which long stood as a Northern bulwark against monsters and barbarian hordes as the Empire collapsed, besieged from without and gnawed from within by the insidious forces of Chaos.

Aquila fell, so the stories say, when the last Emperor, whom some name Romulous and some call Augustus, fled there with a great horde of treasure. The power of Chaos corrupted him through his greed and fear, and he was transformed into the great Dragon that plagues the land to this day. Brave Aquila and her legions perished in flame, and to this day the ruins, fused to blackened glass, still rise among the trees of Eastmarch in Navarre.

After the death of Rome, tribes and minor nations built, flourished, withered, and died across Europe. Slowly, worship of the true gods and the spread of the common tongue helped allow the fractured continent to heal, and Chaos was driven back from the new strongholds it took after the end of the empire. The Navarran tribes under King Charlemagne and his descendants formed several strong nations- Burgundy, Navarre, and Italia, while the Scandian folk settled much of northern Europa in waves of raiding and settlement. And the ancient forest that once spread across the continent, connecting all with a powerful web of sorcery, was slowly cut down, driven back, and tamed.

Around 900, hordes of Chaos cultists, Danes, beastmen, daemons, and worse, under the leadership of the Teutonic Knights, swept from their strongholds in Teutonia and Danemarch and through the League, pillaging and burning. Many in Europa believed it was the End of Days, and the populations of the League, Navarre, Burgundy and Lithuany were decimated by ferocious combat. But through some unknown providence, the forces of Chaos were stopped at the Mystwood in Navarre, scattered to the four winds, and peace returned at great cost.

There then followed more than fifty years of relative prosperity, as brave adventurers and hearty folk retamed many of the ruins and dangerous lands, with the aid of the Miracles of Resurrection. Fallen baronies in Navarre found themselves returned to settlement. Albion secured their northern border from the Picts, and returned many of the folk there to the worship of the Three.

This was not to last.

Fifty years ago, mighty beings of Chaos across Europa finalized diabolic plans, and the very fabric of magic changed forever. Most notably, the Miracles of Resurrection, those holiest of relics, ceased to return the dead. The tides of adventure and exploration ceased, and the Wall of Novgorond was nearly overrun. Teutonia grew mighty, while wholesome nations grew weak. Small settlements returned to the wild, and the Church fractured as none could explain why the Miracles would cease to work. It seemed the Gods had turned their backs on man, and the time of progress in Europa had ended forever.

Until, in 1025, a child attempted to align to the miracle, and was successful. The time of adventure had returned.

# THE MYSTWOOD
Once, long centuries ago, a great unbroken forest stretched from the Western Ocean to the distant steppes of Thule. Primeval and depthless, inhabited by all manner of creatures and filled with wonder and sorcery, the ancients called this the Hercynian Forest, the Forest of Mystwood. Elfkind dwelled within the forest, and grew a vast network of magical paths. These roads, called the Elvish Ways, wove throughout the forest and its surroundings, even venturing into other woods and fens in the distant isles of Britannia, deep valleys in the rocky north of Scandia, and olive groves hard against the warm shores of the Middle Sea.

The numbers of the elves were never large, and wherever humans went, the elves withdrew, whether deeper into the forest, or into the lands of their cousins the Fae. In their hunger for farm land and wood for homes and fuel, the humans broke up the forest, leaving only relicts and remnants. While these ancient woods remained filled with the magic of the waystones, they no longer consistently connected the vast distances as they once did. When at last the Romans came north of the Alps, their precision roads, laid down by geometers, provided the true death blow to the great forest, cutting it into many pieces and rendering the magics forever broken.

The greatest remnant of the ancient Forest is in the land still called Mystwood, in eastern Navarre and the western League, but tracts of the old forest can still be found across Europa- in Aaragon and Teutonia, in Novgorond and Thule. For the vast majority of people, the waystones to be found in the old forests offer only strange dreams and fantastic danger, while for the few, who have learned the knack, it is said that some waystones can still be used to travel, provided the cost is paid.

# GEOGRAPHY AND TRAVEL
The nations of Europa are weak and fragmented lands, where the majority of peasants live in quiet hardship, farming and laboring. The Church of the Three is ubiquitous in most nations, but many could not tell you that it is headquartered in Byzantium. Barons or Counts are the nobility most peasants interact with, and many may not even know the name of their higher lord or King. Indeed, some only know their local Knight. While the reasons for war are often a mystery, the effects are clear enough- most peasants have a sibling or cousin who has died in bloody hardship in the skirmishes of nobles, or worse, to the dark inhuman forces that plague all people in the world of Mystwood.

Chapters are largely concerned only with their local environs, and it is expected most characters know very little about the lands and nations more than a few days travel or so away from their home. The following details are the sorts of information foreigners might have heard about the various nations of Europa. More detailed (and accurate) information can be found in the specific information (the Lorebook) for a given Chapter.

## Aaragon
The westernmost peninsula of Europa, Aaragon is a land divided by history. The north is divided into many small states, headed by powerful and chivalrous knights. These lords follow strict interpretations of Church doctrine, and are beholden to a figurehead king.

The southern part of the peninsula holds a wealthy Tripartite nation, Andalus, famed for scholarship and trade.

The jealous northerners ever seek to drive the southerners back across the Pillars of Hercules to Khemt, and hire many mercenaries from the League and the Italian states to reinforce their armies.

Major cities in Aaragon that foreigners might have heard of include Granada, Santiago, and Zaragoza.

Aaragon is the Europan equivalent of the areas of Portugal and Spain before the Reconquista.

## Albion
The island kingdom of Albion prides itself as a land of virtue, loyalty and strength, though in fact it is as corrupt and venal as most nations. For centuries, Albion waged war against Navarre, Pictland, Eire and Burgundy, seeking to gain or regain any number of claims that the line of Albionese rulers believed to be their birthright. This ended with the death of Elspeth the Great, and Albion now contents itself with managing its own affairs on its isle.

Major cities in Albion that foreigners might have heard of include Coventry, Lundein, and York.

Albion is the equivalent of England and Wales.

## Burgundy
A warm and wealthy land of vineyards, chivalry and song. The last three hundred years have been a slow decline for the nation, as disaster after disaster has struck- in the last hundred years, heresy brought low the city of Carcassona, Nuragian pirates captured the Duke of Toulouse, the Duchy of Provence constantly threatens secession, and areas of the northeast have been taken by Navarre.

Major cities in Aaragon that foreigners might have heard of include Girona, Grenoble, and the capital, Lyon.

Burgundy is the equivalent of the wealthy southern territories now in modern France and eastern Spain- Toulouse, Auvergne, Provence, Savoy, and the real world Aragon.

## Byzantium
On the very cusp of Europa, the mightiest nation of Europa guards the seaways and traders paths to Asia. The Empire of the Byzantines, heirs to Rome, stretches from Thule and Araby over the Anatolian peninsula to Lituany and Teutonia across the land of the Bulgars. The city of Byzantium itself is called “the City of Wonders”, and is the home of the leaders of the Church. The majority of trade from Asia and Araby passes through Byzantium, for Chaos and the tribes of Thule are nearly insurmountable enemies for travelers.

Byzantium is the greatest city of Europa, and nearly everyone has heard of it. Other cities include

Byzantium, of course, represents the Eastern Roman Empire.

## Corsica, Nuragia, and Sicilia
The major islands of the Middle, or “Mediterranean”, Sea have always been at odds with one another. Corsica was a highly populated and civilized spot in the time of Rome, where emperors had their summer homes and the wealth of three continents came together to entertain and enlighten. When Rome fell, Corsica remained “Roman” in nature, and even today the use of Roman names and styles continues. Corsica is fiercely independent, despite the half-hearted efforts of Burgundy, Italia, and Aaragon to change this.

On the other hand, **Nuragia** rebuffs attempts by the rest of Europa to bring them into the fold of society. Chaos worshippers, pirates and exiles call the island home, causing the isle to be a danger to trade and travel for all the seafaring nations. Nuragian pirates plague shipping, especially trade across the sea from Burgundy to Khemt.

**Sicilia** has much in common with Italia culturally, but its strategic location in the Middle Sea has made it the subject of many wars of conquest. From the Hellenes of ancient times, to the Romans, to Berber Tripartites, to the Byzantine, to crusading Navarrans, Europans have always coveted the wealth of the largest island in the Mdidle Sea. Most recently, a line of petty princes descended from the League have found themselves Kings of Sicilia through luck and marriage.

Palermo, on Sicilia, rivals Roma in population and opulence.

**Corsica** is the real world island, while Nuragia is a fantasy replacement for real world Sardinia. Sicilia is, of course, Sicily.

## Danemark
Across the Maer Suebicum from Skandia proper squats Danemark, where since time immemorial Skandians devoted to Chaos have established their footholds before raiding their southern neighbors. Since the Great Horde of 910, and later the Navarran Civil War, Danemark has lain quiet, slowly becoming more civilized and less prone to raiding. This makes them no less dangerous, as Chaos is still common in the country.

Haven is the only city of note in Danemark.

Danemark represents modern day Denmark.

## Eire
Eire is a green and pleasant land off the coast of Albion, settled into several small kingdoms whose borders are nearly ever changing, as clan and family alliances shift. In Eire, the descendants of the Gaelic natives and invaders from both Albion and Norroway have come together to make many new cultures and traditions. So, too, the following of the Three in Eire is unusual, having pre-existed official Church involvement by centuries, and thus is full of peculiarities.

Famous cities in Eire that foreigners might have heard of are Cork and Dubhlinn.

Eire is real world Ireland.

## Hellas
Hellas is claimed by many learned Europans to have been the birthplace of civilization, with the nations of Athens, Sparta, Thebes and others educating the Romans who would follow them in the arts of magic, medicine, architecture, philosophy, and many more. Today it is a quiet land, much given to introspection of its past, and troubled by Fae who masquerade in the images of old gods and monsters. Much of Hellas pays fealty to Byzantium.

Major cities in Hellas that foreigners might have heard of include Athens, Korinth, Sparta, and Tirana.

Hellas is real world Albania, Croatia, and Greece.

## Illyria
Illyria, also called Carpathia, is a mountainous land of many small villages and fortified towns with no central government. The folk of Illyria are much troubled by the Undead, the greatest of which rule as lords and ladies from ruined castles deep in the wasteland. Trade routes and travelers rarely pass through the deep mountains and forests of Illyria, and so those seeking to visit this land travel along the rivers exclusively.

Major cities in Illyria that foreigners might have heard of include Serdica and Visegrad .

Illyria represents the real world Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia.

## Italia - Milan, Napoli, Roma, Tarant, Venezia
The Italian city-states are each proud nations with their own rich histories, though foreign Europans often name them all by the peninsula upon which the nations rest. Milan and Venezia are both wealthy, seafaring nations of traders- Venezia holds a colony in Bulgaria, Varna, while Milanese crossbowmen and fusiliers are present in nearly every major battle in Europa, often on both sides. Napoli is an expansionist nation, while Roma and Tarant content themselves amongst the ruins of former glories.

Milan, Napoli, Roma, Tarant, and Venezia are famous cities in their own right.

Italia represents most of modern Italy.

## Karelia, Kvenland, Norroway, and Ultima Thule
In Skandia, the northernmost peninsula of Europa, lie three weak kingdoms, Norroway, Kvenland, and Karelia. The many Jarls, petty kings, and war-chiefs of those lands sometimes take ship to raid Albion, Navarre and the League- when they are not fighting each other- and will not let any merchant pass through their seas without heavy payment. Along the edges of the kingdoms, loyalties often flow back and forth- a jarl might be Norrowegian one year, and Kvenner the next.

Ultima Thule, the westernmost island of Europa, is populated by farmers and fishers of Norrowegian ancestry and is nominally ruled from the mainland.

Many in the lands of Skandia worship old gods who bear many names, though in the last fifty years great inroads have been made in joining the faithful here with the Church.

Karelia represents Finland, while Kvenland, Norroway, and Ultima Thule are roughly Sweden, Norway, and Iceland respectively.

## Lituany
Once the mightiest nation in Europa, Lituany has suffered much from the expansions of Byzantium, Thule, and Novgorond, though their greatest foe is Teutonia. Today, the subjects of the Grand Duke dream of lost glories, and plan endlessly to reconquer their ancient capital, Vilnius, which has long been held by the Knights Teutonic.

Lituany is physically located in and around real-world Belarus and Ukraine.

## The League
The rough analog of medieval Germany, the League is a group of many different petty nations and free towns within vast forests. The people of the northern part of the League are much hardened by their struggle with the Chaos followers of Danemark and Teutonia, and little given to mercy. Much of the commerce of the League relies on trade and travel between Novgorond, Albion, and Navarre, and heavily armed merchant caravans and coast-hugging trade ships ply the roads and waves. The southern city-states of the League often struggle against Milan in trade wars and boundary disputes.

The League is roughly the area of modern day Germany.

## Navarre
A strong, if decentralized nation, Navarre is comprised of three duchies- Eastmarch, Flanders, and L’Isle- and two Marches- Bretony and Burgundar. The last few years have been tumultuous for Eastmarch and for Burgundar, with a new Duchess and a new Margrave both rising to power in 968 after civil war. The rest of Navarre is largely concerned with a simmering war with Albion over the lands of Normandia and Gascon, with both nations having interests and claims in those regions.

## Novgorond
A mercantile state formed by an alliance of Norse and Rus centuries ago, Novgorond has expanded far beyond its original borders. There is great disparity, and many rivalries, between the wealthy and cultured townsfolk and the mean and poor serfs who dwell in the villages. Nevertheless, all are united in the protection of their homeland. Novgorond’s most famed feature is the Wall of the Defenders, an unfinished yet mighty barricade against the worst of the Thulian menace.

## Pictland and Orkney
Pictland, sharing the northern portion of the island of Britain, was once not dissimilar from Eire. The Church never became strong there, though, so the worship of Chaos and the Fae has continued unabated. While there may be goodly folk in Pictland, the majority of those in power are devoted to Chaos and the strife it causes.

North of Pictland is a tiny nation of Norrowegian exiles, called Orkney, who ambitiously dream of someday reconquering ancestral lands in the north of Albion. Lastly, far away in Oceanus can be found the treeless isle of Ultima Thule, or Issland, a fractious land of clans and farms where freedom-loving Norrowegians fled long ago.

## Teutonia
Once led by goodly knights, long ago those same warriors fell one by one to Chaos, and now Teutonia is the mightiest nation of Chaos in the known world. It was they who led the vast Chaotic armies which nearly crushed the League and Navarre a hundred years ago. This Chaos horde caused the nations of Italia, Burgundy, Albion and Navarre to leave aside their conflicts for a time to unite, however briefly, and drive them back. The dark knights of Teutonia have since bided their time, marshaled their forces, and quarreled amongst themselves, dreaming of a day when a new and charismatic ruler will rise to take control of the forces of Chaos once more.

## Vasqony
North of Aaragon, however, is the land of Vasqony, a land wholly given to Chaos, whose raiders are quick to attack Bretony and L’Isle when given the chance. The Vasques neither speak the Common tongue, nor allow worshippers of the Three to live if captured.

# Lands Beyond Europa

## Aegyptus, Barbary, and Khemt
Across the Middle Sea is Khemt, land of great serpents, pre-human ruins, and cyclops. Along the north coast of Khemt is the lawless land of Barbary, home of vicious pirates. Aegyptus, tomb-haunted waste of the ancient world, is in the northeast of Khemt. Most Europans are familiar only with Barbary and Aegypt, little aware that there is a huge continent full of good and noble people across the mighty Sahar desert.

## Araby
The homeland of the Tripartites, the land of Araby is the source of many strange and wondrous tales, such as flying carpets, magic rings, and the great Elemental lords known as “genies”. The ruins of mighty civilizations- Sumer, Ashur, and Babylon- dot the wastes, summoning treasure hunters from all over the world. Alas, beastmen and worse haunt the stony desert.

## The Distant East - Thule, Hind, Cathay and Scythia
The Eastern edge of Europa is dominated by the vast, trackless steppe of Thule- little known and seldom visited. The majority of the populace of those lands are nomadic. Some of these nomads will trade with Europans, and may even worship the Three. Others, however, are Chaotic through and through, such as the vile Scythians.

Beyond Thule, it is said there are two great and foreign nations- Hind, where the followers of one thousand gods dwell, and Cathay, a mighty empire more ancient and glorious than Rome. But few have been there, and returned to describe them.

# SOCIAL STRUCTURE

## Disclaimer
The Europa of Mystwood is a far more accepting place, in some ways, than our own world. Players may present their characters as any gender or lack thereof that they prefer. While Knights typically are addressed as "Sir" or "Dame" for male or female-presenting knights, knights of any gender may choose to go by either or simply “Knight” as they prefer. Along the same lines "Priest" and "Priestess", "Father" and "Mother", "Brother" and "Sister" are often used as addresses for religious characters. Any religious character may use any of these addresses, or a more neutral "Holy" or “Sibling”.

Further, unless one is noble, the issue of whether one's parents were married is a matter of faith, not of law. It is not unusual for same sex couples to marry, raise children, possess property together, etc. Further, it is uncommon, but not noteworthy, for a person to have multiple partners, especially for followers of the Wild. Two or more people cohabiting as partners are treated the same way by the law, regardless of religious marriage, and many people address one another as "husband", "wife", or "spouse" with no legal documentation. Any firstborn child, regardless of gender, is equally eligible for inheritance, if the deceased has accepted that they are their child. Adoption is freely accepted with no stigma, especially in dangerous places where many families are sundered by battle, plague, and famine. Some characters may choose to call themselves "bastard" children, but this is entirely their own social construct- society is accepting of such offspring, reserving "bastard" status for unclaimed children whose parentage may be unknown.

While all people are equal by the above definitions, Mystwood is still a land of stratified classes. The nations of Europa all possess hereditary, landed nobility, and most possess a knighthood or similar position which is gained by merit. There are also downtrodden peasants, and, below them, serfs. These social distinctions are described below.

## Nobility
At the top of the social structure in most nations of Europa are the nobility- rulers of great realms and their extended families. Their positions are hereditary and derive, in theory, from ancient claims of descent from legendary kings and queens. In their own minds, their power is near absolute. In practicality, it often extends no further than their reach. Nobility are bound by only one law- that they must keep their oaths. It is common, therefore, for them to be forced through various political maneuverings to swear to uphold certain laws or practice. This effectively grants various rights to the lower ranks of society, but these same rights are subject to change from generation to generation.

Each noble holds a castle (or castles) as their seat of power, and extensive lands, which are often somewhat intermingled with those of other nobles. Nobles theoretically own all land, but parcel much of it out to others in return for service, much like the feudal system of historical Europe. No player character may be a noble in Mystwood- after all, why would a noble dwell in rough villages in the midst of monster-infested wildernesses?- but becoming a noble may be a goal that can rarely be achieved in character retirement.

Nobles do not collect taxes as we understand the term in the present day. Instead, they must earn the money to run their affairs through the renting of their land, most often in the form of collecting a portion of the harvest, charging various fees for the use of their roads, forests, mills and so on, and through certain monopolies, often milling or brewing.

In certain cases there may be “levies”- cash payments demanded from every person in a domain for wars, weddings, castle building and so on. These are one time occurrences, and generally very unpopular- often enforced at the point of a sword.

While different domains call the titles differently, the same tiers of nobility are common throughout Europa. Europa is a far more orderly place than our real world medieval Europe, and so the many, many titles, lines of obligation, and land divisions tend to be less complicated.

### Kingdoms
The highest of nobility are Kings, Queens, or Sovereigns. These great rulers directly rule lands similar in size and power to duchies, though other Dukes and Duchesses have sworn allegiance and their realms to those rulers, creating kingdoms. A sovereign’s word is law throughout their own duchy within their kingdom. Within other duchies, the ruling Duke’s will overrides the sovereign if there is a disagreement, though a sovereign is unlikely to forget this. Sovereigns often hold sufficient minor titles within their own duchy and others to be considered counts or barons, though they rarely use these titles, sometimes passing them on to children. Sovereigns are referred to as “Your Majesty”or “Your Royal Highness”.

### Duchies
Most of the land of Europa belongs to a duchy, where the ruler is called a Duke, Duchess, or Grace. Most of the time, Dukes are sworn to a kingdom, though on the outskirts of Europa, ducal powers rule lands they call kingdoms, such as in Eire and Carpathia. Duchies are subdivided into multiple baronies, and often several minor counties, which a duke will often rule directly as their own fief. Ducal nobles are referred to as “Your Grace”.

### Baronies
Baronies and their rulers are the most common nobility in Europa. Typically, each barony is large enough to support about 20 manors, about fifty to seventy percent of which are held by Knights of the Realm. Other manors are maintained by important clergy, relatives of the baron, and wealthy families who have purchased the honor and now enjoy hereditary privileges. The Baron title, especially for women, is sometimes styled Baroness. They are referred to as “Your Highness”.

### Counties
Counties, the smallest holding of true nobility, are ruled by a Count, and typically possess one to four manors or other valuable properties. Counts do not swear vassalage to The Count title, especially for women, is sometimes styled Countess. They are referred to as “Your Lordship”,“Your Ladyship”, or “My Count”.

### Manors
As noted above, most manors are held by Knights of the Realm. A manor typically spans over 700 to 1500 acres, land enough for 20 to 40 families, and usually contains a small village to support the farms and industry. If the ruler of a manor is not a Knight, they are titled Lord or Lady, or make use of whatever other title they might possess.

### Allods
Occasionally, the Church or a noble will provide special ownership and self-governance to a person, religious order, or company. These special titles, called allods, are areas which become their own realms in miniature. Generally no larger than a county, allods are rare in the modern era, many belonging to the Church or remaining allodial since the time of the Roman Empire. The majority of allodial holdings are monasteries, abbeys, and certain large manors surrounded by ancient countries such as Navarre, Roma, and the League.

## Free Commoners
The majority of the folk of Europa, and indeed all player characters at the start of play, are Free Commoners, who comprise somewhat more than half the population of a given domain. These are the folk of the villages and towns, who are not tied to the land by custom or necessity. They practice trades such as blacksmithing, herding, and tailoring, and may hold land directly from a lord themselves. They are generally free to pursue any path they wish, and travel more or less freely. They provide the bulk of the armed forces of the nobility in the form of war levies, and in time of war may form militia bands to defend their homes. They are generally well armed, but rarely own significant armor, which is unsurprising given that a suit of metal armor costs about the same as a car in modern terms.

Free commoner player characters are often second children, folk who have no inheritances, or those who have left a career for one reason or another. As such, such characters are free (or forced) to move to the dangerous areas where Mystwood Chapters are located in order to take advanctage of opportunity.

### Knighthood

Knighthood in most lands is NOT hereditary. Instead, any commoner can become a knight through acts of valor and proving their worth.

At some point during a person's questing at the tasks, an existing knight or lord takes an interest in the further career of the fellow, and will arrange to take the prospect as a squire. A would-be knight would do well to contact their local heralds, as well, who will in turn contact the various knightly orders with news and description of the candidate's heroic deeds.

Often, a sufficiently powerful domain will have public lists of tasks that a would-be knight might attempt, commonly collection of funds for the Church or for the duchy, arranging the destruction of Chaos or Death Components, the slaying of some famed monster, or the like. It is traditional that a person accomplishes seven of these tasks before they are considered worthy of the title of Knight, though exceptions have been made for the truly impressive. Meanwhile, some obviously unworthy fellows have labored for years at dozens of tasks, only to be rebuffed- though this is rare.

Knighthood is bestowed by the nobility, but it is required that the College of Heralds concur. Since only a knight can inherit stewardship of a knight's land, this means that land changes hands frequently from generation to generation. Abuse of the system, such as knighthoods being purchased or knighthood denied in order to “break” a knightly family is rare, but not unheard of.

By law, knights are given a number of privileges- leadership in time of war, bearing arms in almost any situation, and the right of Trial by Combat. While knighthood is a great honor, at most Chapters becoming a knight is quite rare as there are limited spots for knights in the area. A character pursuing knighthood should have other personal goals beyond acquiring this role.

## Serfs
Last and lowest socially are serfs, slaves and thralls. Some are free peasants who were forced, in time of famine, to voluntarily bond themselves to a lord in exchange for food. Others are those who have become debtors in other ways, children of serfs, or (rarely) prisoners captured in war. Still others have remained serfs since time immemorial, bound to the land and their lord.

Their status varies a great deal. In some villages, the difference between free folk and serfs is merely a legal point, and you cannot readily tell who is who. In others, serfs are not permitted to bear arms, and are ground down into abject poverty by the demands of their lord or lady. Serfdom is hereditary, as debts are inherited by children from their parents along with property. No serf is allowed to leave their land without their lord's permission.

By a custom as ancient as that of knighthood, any serf can purchase their freedom for a price equivalent to the cost to feed a family for a year, or about 200 coin, generally equal to what caused their family to become serfs in the first place. A thrifty and fortunate serf can save this amount in a few years, but a poor harvest can easily cast down a free family, forcing them to place themselves in their lord's hands in exchange for grain from the castle stores.

Slavery and thralldom are practiced in unpleasant, out of the way places throughout Europa, often practiced by Chaos worshippers and Skandians. In the civilized nations of Europa, the buying and selling of men is variably punished, and most nefarious folk who would desire to own the lives of another name it serfdom and find legal precedents.

# LANGUAGES AND WRITING
Most of the peoples of Europa speak a “Common” tongue derived from Latin and a mix of local languages. This language was spread by the Church in the last several hundred years in order to facilitate communication and education, and sounds remarkably like real-world modern English. The Latin alphabet is used for all writing and is, again, largely the same throughout Europa. Spoken Latin is a dead language, though still used in ceremonies, mottos, and incantations. Real-world languages common in Medieval times- German, French, Norse, Spanish, Russian, and dozens more- exist in minor form in writing, and are used especially in place names, oaths, and mottos.

The peoples neighboring the core of Europa- Vasques, Skandians, Khemtians, Arabians and the like- often do not speak the common tongue, making them strange and foreign to the rest of Europa. Furthermore, nonhumans who dwell in Europa often have only a minimal understanding of the common tongue, speaking in broken sentences.

# MAGIC AND CHAOS

# HOLIDAYS OBSERVED ACROSS EUROPA

## Springal
Over 1300 years before the current day, Emperor Julius Caesar established the Julian Calendar, setting the date of the vernal equinox as March 25th, the first day of spring.

Because of a variety of factors, not least of which being poor astronomical observation, the influence of magic on time in certain areas, and generally spotty record keeping, the vernal equinox has actually shifted in the calendar.

Nevertheless, the holiday celebrating the equinox has always occurred on March 25th. In certain nations, especially those to the east (such as Lituany and Novogorond), March 25th is the New Year, but in much of Europa it is simply Springal, a day of merriment, thanksgiving, and community.

Springal celebrates the rebirth of warmth and the field, from the cold of the winter. New green leaves and spring flowers are gathered for wreaths  and eggs collected. Often these eggs are boiled, dyed in garish colors, and given as gifts to the young, the aged, and the infirm.

Lambs and suckling pigs are slaughtered and roasted, the finest parts given as gifts to family friends or to the church.

Families come together on the village green for games and merriment, and young folk go courting for the objects of their desires. In parishes where the people are particularly devout, the populace may come together to embrace their church-house, a practice called "clipping", and in the cities the wealthy will pass out loaves of bread with sweetmeats, fish, coins or other presents within them. Occasionally certain crimes will be absolved or ignored on Springal, most notably poaching, and for certain poor families a meal of hart or forest's boar on Springal is the best meat they will have all year.

In all, Springal is a fine day of merriment, a reminder that in a troubled world, full of Chaos, war, disease and inequity, still there is the promise of a new year, and with it, new opportunities.

## Emperor's Day (All Saint's Day)
The 31st of October, a day at once devoted to fear and to celebration, is variably known as Emperor's Day and All Saint's Day.

Eight hundred years or more ago, the last Emperor of Rome, Romulus (or Augustulus) was crowned Emperor on October 31st at Ravenna, then the capital of the Western Empire. Little did the nobles and Senate of the Empire know that Romulus Augustulus would be the final Emperor. What is known of that time is at best complicated by long history, and at worst outright lies fabricated over centuries by the servants of the Dragon.

What little is known suggests that a man named Ricimer, a Tolosan Visigoth, was the Master of the Legions at the time, and had great political influence. So, too, was Rome harassed in the north by the Milanese King Odoacer. The histories variably suggest that Romulus was a mighty Emperor who brought the wonders collected by Rome and Aegyptus before it to Aquila for safekeeping, or that Romulus was a weak, fearful man who fled there with his personal wealth.

Regardless of his reasons, all know that Romulus Augustulus was transformed into the great Dragon of Mystwood, whose rampage of fire and death spread chaos throughout Europa and destroyed the Empire forever- but, the Emperor himself has never died. The Dragon merely sleeps.

And so it is that Emperor's Day has been celebrated with feasting for centuries throughout Europa, out of superstitious dread that the Dragon might know who was paying him disrespect, and visit with destruction. Children, and even grown adults, go masked from home to home, feasting on candies, pastries and gifts of meat and cheese. Candles are lit, and horrible faces carved from turnips and pumpkins, so that the monstrous servants of the Dragon might be confused into thinking that goodly townsfolk and peasants are also servants of evil. And the church houses are filled to the brim with the faithful- with the doors strongly barred.

In Navarre and neighboring areas, a change of feeling has occurred in the last hundred years regarding Emperor's Day. St. Jeheanne died defending all Navarrans from the Albionese, and in her return spoke plainly regarding the need for Navarrans to come together as one people against the rise of Chaos, both from outside Navarre and within.

And so, in this newer tradition, folk are enticed to gather together into feasting halls and the houses of the wealthy, where games are to be had and tales told. Often, the trappings are the same- pumpkin carving and the like. Truth-telling games are played, and oaths against Chaos or Unlife renewed. Often, a certain undertone of suspicion is found, where neighbors watch neighbors for any action or word that might be taken amiss. Travelers and wanderers especially are forced to attend such feasts, and in some places parties of masked celebrants go forth into the forest, rounding up the hermits and charcoal burners of the hills and forcing them to be social for one day a year. In addition, Justice followers sometimes use this day to set public atonements.

# WAR AND REBELLION
War ebbs and flows across the Known World. Armies march, and great battles are fought. These battles are decided most often by the charge of armored knights, massed ranks of archers, and hordes of poorly armed peasants.

The lands where Chapters are located are normally outlands and marches, where great armies cannot easily traverse unreliable paths and hostile denizens. Nevertheless even remote places see a near perpetual state of conflict between small bands of warriors. Most of these battles are against various raiders, fell beasts, and chaos spawn.

It is possible that some combination of events could lead to the player characters at a Chapter rising in rebellion against the local authority. The downside of being in out of the way spaces is that it is generally easy for a ruler to block trade and travel to the areas where Chapters are located. If a popular revolt rises up in a town or village, nobles and the Church will be quick to move and end such treason. Open conflict with the lords of the kingdoms will cause the economy of the Chapter to collapse, and many Occupations will lose the use of some of their skills and abilities. Extended rebellion will result in famine, disease, and armed retribution. This may be a price worth paying, but it should be understood in advance.

# LAWS AND JUSTICE

## The Code Civitas
The kingdoms of Europa have many laws, some fair and enlightened, most not so much. The vast majority of these are compiled in various “Codes Civitas”, usually descended from the laws of old Rome, and rarely play a role in the game. There may be a penalty for failing to keep your livestock out of your neighbor's field, but it’s not likely to be an issue for your character. Nor are you likely to be punished for mixing sand in your baked goods, failing to keep up the sections of road near your house, or failing to maintain your weapons for time of need. Indeed, few of the tenets of the Code Civitas are enforced on player characters in Mystwood.

There are several notable exceptions, which will affect the everyday life of your character, and these follow. In many ways, these laws are in game mechanics designed to maintain the atmosphere of the setting. If a character cannot pay their fine, they may be subject to public humiliation, a short period of work, or brief exile from the town. Your local Chapter may have other or additional laws which you will be expected to follow.

The Code Civitas is enforceable by local guards, and is not subject to trial.

## Blasphemy, Gibbering and Ranting
This is a polite way of saying “Talking out of game in in-game areas”. NPCs and other players will react to such talk as foul profanity. The fine is 5 crown. There are some areas that are fine for talking out of game- but the main areas of the game such as the tavern and town square are not them.

## Brandishing
Armed strangers allowed into towns with their weapons bared have destroyed many villages. To that end, guards often require that weapons be sheathed or peace bonded.
Brandishing weapons is punishable with a warning or a 1 crown fine. Bows, staffs, tools and the like are normally exempt from this requirement.

## Due Payment
It is illegal to take labor or goods from a non-serf without payment. Although intended to prevent enslavement, this law is also used to discourage vagrancy, and enforce a guild's fees. This is punishable by a fine of twice the value due, with half of the fine going to the victim.

There are further clauses to the law of Due Payment-
* One who is cured of an affliction must pay the healer as agreed, pay 4 crown, or offer one hour's service.
* Those who request to be depicted favorably in song, story, text, or illustration shall offer crown, a minor service, or payment as agreed.
* Those who receive food and drink shall offer coin in payment, or if they have none, they shall perform a service such as the washing of dishes.

## Public Nuisance
One must always act appropriately within the town, and failure to show respect to those with higher social status is a crime. Serfs must be respectful to commoners, commoners to knights, knights to nobles, etc. This is punishable with a warning, or a 1 crown fine.

# THE CODE JUSTINIAN
The Code Justinian, based on the law code of the Byzantine Empire, deals with grave crimes, and is far more likely to come into play during a Mystwood Event. All Justinian Code crimes require an accuser in order to be prosecuted. Without someone willing to swear that the accused is guilty, no prosecution is possible. However, the accused has no particular right to face their accuser, and it is perfectly acceptable to make an anonymous accusation before a magistrate. False accusation is a crime, and thus only the brave or certain will do so, and any accusation that does not result in a conviction is deemed false.

The following are overviews of the law, and the spirit of these laws is more important than their letter in most cases. Enforcement of these laws is the privilege of Magistrates (or a similar Occupation), and so their judgment is as important (or more so) than the letter of the law. It is likely that local Chapters will have specific guidelines on how these laws are to be enforced, and if there are additional or differing laws which are important for that locality.

## Assault
Punishable by a fine agreed on by the assaulted person and the magistrate, or Chastisement. Note that there is a wide range of assault. Sometimes, assault is punishable by a small fine. Other times it may be immense.

## Corruption
Any action that raises Undead, or causes one to become Undead is Corruption. Similarly, summoning Daemons, willingly accepting a Mark of Chaos, or willful actions that lead to yourself or another receiving a Mark of Chaos. Action that results in harm through traffic with Chaos is also Corruption, (such as releasing a plague), as is actual worship of a Chaos being or accepting Unlife. Harm resulting indirectly, such as a summoned undead that kills somebody) is punishable as if the character caused the harm themselves. Punishable by Death.

## Consorting with Undead or Chaos
This is the use of Chaos or Undeath with intent to gain, that does not result in harm to others. Trafficking in Death or Chaos Components is considered Consortium. This is considered a lesser offense than Corruption. Punishable by a fine of 50 crown, or Chastisement. A second offense is punishable by Branding, a third by Death.

## Dark Magic
Defined as use of the Chaos or Death Components in magic without a permit, or the casting of any spell with “Chaos” in the name. Other, more amorphous magical acts deemed to be dangerous to the public good also fall into this category. Punishable by a fine of 25 crown or Chastisement, unless it results in harm to innocent individuals, in which case the sorcerer is punished as Consortium or Corruption in addition to the 25 crown fine. A third offense punishable by Branding.

## False Accusation
If an accused individual is not found guilty, the accuser will face the punishment the accused would have received. For instance, the false accusation of murder could result in the punishment of Death for the accuser.

## High Treason
High Treason is criminal disloyalty to the state- the local Baron, Duke, or other high nobility. Participating in warfare against soldiers of your own lord, spying, assassination, forgery, and sabotage of noble holdings are the most commonly encountered. Punishable by Death in all cases.

## Murder and Attempted Murder
Punishable by Death or a fine: 100 crown for a serf, 300 for a commoner, 500 for a knight. The Justinian Code makes no distinction between the two crimes. In Mystwood, sending someone to be resurrected at the local Miracle is Attempted Murder.

## Theft and Vandalism
Punishable by fine of twice the value of the stolen or destroyed goods, or by Chastisement. Half the fine goes to the victim, half to the local ruler. Second offense punishable by Branding, third by Death. Fraud is treated as theft. Poaching is considered High Treason, see above.

## Judgment and Trials
The accused may either submit to the judgment of the magistrate, or demand a trial. If a trial is chosen, the punishment is often heavier.

Normally the accused may choose the type of trial, however the magistrate does have the right to overrule the accused in special circumstances. Trials take three forms.

- **Trial by Juror**: The magistrate will appoint three jurors, who will be given a short time, often a day, to investigate the case. Upon their return, they will render their verdict. Many jurors are semi-professional, and it is common to allow both accused and accuser to choose one juror. They are thus a cross between lawyers and detectives.
- **Trial by Ordeal**: The accused undertakes some kind of test, usually dangerous, painful, or both. Survival or success is taken as sign of innocence. This is most often used in cases where there is little chance of establishing the facts of the case, but strong circumstantial evidence exists.
- **Trial by Combat**: This is a right that is due to all Knights, and may be denied to others. It may be requested by the accuser when they wish to carry out justice themselves, or by the defendant when they allege the accuser has harmed them in turn. It is permissible to have someone fight for you in most cases.

## Punishments
- **Branding**: Branding is an Affliction (“Afflict with Branding”), which results in a permanent -1 reduction to maximum Hit Points, and a permanent mark which must be worn, normally a letter or image representing the crime (T for theft, C for Corruption, and so on). Branded criminals are obviously not usually welcome in polite society, but in some places it is a mark of honor. If this would reduce you to 0 maximum Hit Points, you instead are reduced to 1 and cannot run, jump, or shout.
- **Death**: Death is carried out by an executioner in a manner determined by a magistrate. Due to local Miracles of Resurrection and other wonders, many in Mystwood will survive their own executions. If they repented before their deaths, this is considered sufficient punishment for their crime, but if they do not, they are usually banished from the settlement for several hours. Death by Execution always consumes the Gift of Justice first, rather than the Gift of Mercy, and next the Gift of the Wild if the Gift of Justice has been used. The Gift of Mercy is used last in this case.
- **Chastisement**: Chastisement takes many forms, at the discretion of the magistrate. In the Keep of Mystwood, for example, it normally consists of half an hour in a crow cage, the maiming of limbs, or being made to wear a sign describing one's misdeeds. In addition to the “in-game” portion of the chastisement, it comes with a penalty of hard labor, assumed to take place between Events. The result of this is to reduce your Maximum Hit Points by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for the entirety of your next Event.

# THE CHURCH AND FAITH
Long ago, there were many cults and sects devoted to many gods. Though holy men and women sought to lead others toward what was good, differences often led to bloodshed between those who should have made common cause against Chaos. Over time, wise folk came to understand that there were but three true and holy gods, and those were unified in a single Church, though each sect preserves many of its own practices.

The followers of Justice build tall churches and uphold what is good and just- honor, law, order, chivalry, marriage, and family. Their rites are solemn and thoughtful.

The followers of Mercy believe less in ceremony and more in action, above all striving to live lives worthy of their goddess. They labor on behalf of the less fortunate, collect alms, and are always ready to spill their blood in battle for a worthy cause. Many throughout history have been martyred for their beliefs.

The followers of the Wild hold their ceremonies in field and forest. Their god has dominion over all natural things, and over the bodily needs of the people. There is much mysticism in the cult of the Wild, ancient rites that others look askance at.

At one time, the Church was organized and governed from a center of faith at Byzantium by the Triarch. Alas, the senior officials of the Church were assassinated en masse fifty years ago at the Synod of St. Disagreements over the recovery of the church structure has led to many competing sects, each claiming to be the one true creed of the faith. A Prelate rules over the faith in Novgorond, while the faith in the League and Milan has been taken over by Bishop-Princes, who rule both secular and religious domains that do not always overlap. Your Mystwood Chapter will provide more information on the structure of the Church in that area.

Below the high leaders of the church, each faith has its own structure, rites, places of worship, and sects, though all three do hold certain places sacred. Monasteries and abbeys are often, but not always, consecrated to one of the three, while chapels and temples usually have altars to more than one. Considerable variation exists in the details of theology and practice from kingdom to kingdom, and even village to village, but all within the Church are united in certain core beliefs.

# THE MIRACLES OF RESURRECTION
Scattered across the lands of Europa are places of unusual connection to the gods.

Someone who is attuned to one Miracle of Resurrection is attuned to them all. When someone that is attuned to the Miracles of Resurrection is within an hour’s walking distance and has reached the Dead state, they transform into a spirit, and as a spirit journey to the resurrection place. During this journey, they may not speak or act, but must walk quietly with their head bowed.

# THE BESTIARY
Humankind, the children of the gods, make up the vast majority of the population of the world of Mystwood. Over time, however, Magic has touched the bloodlines of many, and their appearance varies. Some show pointed ears or small horns, others unusual markings on their skin, or colors in their hair. These are accepted by society as long as they are not too extreme.

## Local Genesis of “Monsters”
Many philosophers, witch hunters, knights Templar, and the like have studied the creatures which plague humanity in various areas. It has been observed that the strength and nature of the supernatural varies, depending on location and the peoples who dwell nearby. Thus, a peaceful village in the heart of well-patrolled lands is unlikely to be troubled by great monsters regularly. On the other hand, a superstitious folk dwelling in a land known for stories of gods, men, and monsters is likely to be harassed regularly by all manner of creatures drawn from myth and folklore. The incursions of Chaos, depredations of war, and the panic spread by rumor all serve their part in engendering new horrors to plague humanity. It is believed that one day, when the Three have triumphed, such monsters, supernatural plagues, and evil phenomena which serve to harm mankind will finally be undone. Practically, this means that monsters you may meet in one locale by a given name may vary greatly in strength and appeara
Regardless of area, there are several orders of beings that are common. These creatures are listed below.

## Chaos
Chaos, the Great Enemy of Mankind, comes in many forms. Cultists dwell secretly in every city, corrupting their neighbors and friends to sin. The Knights of Teutonia serve the Lords of Chaos in parody of goodly kingdoms, mutants haunt the forests, and daemons contrive ways to leave their strange realms to corrupt reality. As cults, mutants, and daemons are common throughout Europa, most have heard a tiny bit about these things, but Chaos is fickle and fecund, and the best assumption when facing Chaos is to expect nothing.

## Cults
Cults of Chaos come in many forms, with wildly different ways based on the vice which is preferred by the Cult. Chaos cults fight amongst themselves nearly as much as they fight against law and civilization, and two cults both nominally allegiant to a given vice may fight to the death upon encountering one another.
Throughout Europa, there are many hundreds of cults, though a few in service to mighty powers of Chaos permeate the nations- The Sisters of Slaughter, the Changer of Ways, and the Grandfather are all great beings of Chaos whose cults are common and widespread. Most common folk know nothing more than the names of these cults and that they leave horror and death in their wake.

## Mutants
Some whose flesh is marred by Chaos bear extreme changes- hands mutated into claws or tentacles, backs covered in sharp spikes, large horns, additional eyes, and the like. These are called Mutants. Proximity to corrupted places, beings, magic, and the like seems to cause mutation through little-understood ways. Mutation is most common at birth, but can occur later in life as well.

Most mutants can speak, and will at times trade or negotiate with ordinary folk. The Church teaches that they are to be pitied and showed charity and mercy, so long as they did nothing willfully to bring on their state. Alas, many mutants are loyal to the forces of Chaos. Those who are not are superstitiously said to bring misfortune, ill luck, and further mutation with them, and thus are sometimes driven out into the wilderness. Despite the teachings of the Church, many lords order the killing of mutants in their lands out of hand.

Mutation can touch animals as well as humans, and it is so that Beastmen are created. Beastmen most often have the heads of beasts, but the form of men. Minotaurs are the greatest of their kind, but nearly any animal can be so changed. Beastmen have enough intelligence to make use of weapons and occasional scraps of armor and clothing, but can rarely speak more than a few words of the common tongue. Universally they are savage servants of Chaos, with a great hatred of humankind.

While common mutants may be pitied, there are greater creatures that must be feared. Chaos may work a greater transformation in powerful Gifted individuals, one fitting to the vice that lured them into darkness. Their flesh and spirit are transformed, and they become Chimera. These beings are the monsters of legend- Medusae spawned by Vanity, Draconians of Greed, Gorgons of Rage, plague-bearing Harpies, and many more.

## Daemons
Worse than Beastmen are the Daemons of Chaos. Creatures of pure Chaos, they are summoned briefly into the mortal world for purposes of mayhem, after which they disappear once more. They have a thousand forms, from the least warriors and nuisances, to greater Daemons of enormous power and intellect. Often they come in near unending waves from gates, portals, or icons. Thankfully such occasions are rare.

## Knights of Chaos
The most powerful of Chaos’ mortal servants are the so-called Chaos Knights. Clad in strange armor and capable of great feats of evil, the might of a Chaos Knight is as much or more the product of the armor- always powerful artifacts of magic- as it is the wearer. Indeed, many Chaos Knights are often known and described more by their harness and heraldry than their own personalities. For example, the mighty Stormbringer armor, which plagued the Mystwood Keep for many years, was worn by no less than four mortal beings in the course of a decade, its own daemonic personality usurping and controlling the mortal within. The armor of Chaos Knights is notoriously difficult to destroy, and can regenerate from even small pieces. Invariably, such mortal lords of Chaos attract followings of evil beings- cultists, daemons, and worse.

## Elementals
Chaos is not responsible for all the daemons that find their way to the mortal world. While less common, Elementals are the daemonic counterparts of the other elements besides Chaos- Air, Fire, Life, and the like. Where ley lines cross, or places of great connection to an elemental plane can be found, elementals follow. Some form from the natural world, while others are beings of great power and age which normally dwell in strange places of their pure element and only visit Europa when called by magicians, or for their own inscrutable purposes.

Many elementals are mindless, existing only to rampage the lands or protect the wellspring that formed them. Others are sentient, even named, and can be bargained with or even served, granting unusual powers or knowledge to their followers.

## Fae
Less easily categorized are the Fae- woses, pucks, redcaps, kelpies, korreds, sprites, sylphs and the like. The Fae themselves are largely silent on their ultimate origins and abilities, though a few things are known.

The Fae are nonhuman beings whose native form, at least for the most powerful, is spirit-like. Some fae, especially the so called common fae, link themselves to elements, places, animals or the like and take up traits of those beings. The more powerful make use of mind-affecting magic called glamors to appear as regal lords and ladies of men, but usually with strange variations, such as pointed ears, wings, horns and the like.

Most fae are mischievous and powerful, talented in the arts of magic, long lived and restive. The fae are known to never lie, but they often speak in such a way as to mislead and trick the listener. Their culture makes use of favors owed and due as bargaining chips in the unknown economies of their nations, which are called Courts. The greatest Courts are the Seelie, who aspect themselves toward sun, summer, fire and emulating human nobility; and the Unseelie, who aspect themselves towards cold, darkness, night, and the terror of the dark forest. There are many other Courts of Fae, as well as independent fae of many types.
## Goblinkind
Common throughout Europa are green, grey, or blue-skinned goblins who move nomadically in tribes, stealing and slaying, living much like human bandits. Some count the goblins as fae, and this seems proven by their ability to twist waystones, using them to travel to and from their own lands. They are seldom a powerful force, and even small villages tend to be able to drive off goblins when they approach. In this way, they are much like giant rats- a nuisance, and part of life in the dark medieval.

Much feared but rarely seen of late, the powerful Orcs of the Gray Mountains were once a plague on both Burgundy and Navarre. With underground strongholds and mines boring deep into the stone from their base in Mt. Draka, these orcs are slavers and murderers of great cunning and skill. The Duergar of the Gray Mountains, never friends of the orcs, have long battled with them for control of precious metals and other resources. The orcs of the Gray Mountains are much devoted to the worship of Chaos, often going painted with the Star of Discord and prone to berserk rages. There are orcs who live with virtue and honor, however, and care must be taken to determine the nature of any orc group that is met.

Meanwhile, in the area of Fenwyck and the northern portion of the Mystwood, the swamps are infested with quiet goblins of a much different disposition. These so called "marshlings" are furtive, stealthy creatures, fond of robbery, but little prone to overt malice or murder- indeed, some of these goblins can be spoken to and traded with. Marshling goblins tend to favor the hit-and-run tactic, using bows and thrown weapons with great precision.

The League (and thus, the Mystwood) is sometimes bothered by a breed of goblin which is, bizarrely, blue-skinned. These so-called "Hobgoblins" dress in strange garb reminiscent of the East, and chant in odd tongues. They do not appear to worship Chaos, at least not openly, but neither are they friends of man.

Ogres and Trolls dwell nearly everywhere, in small numbers. Typically, ogres are brutish gray-skinned wretches, speaking the common tongue, but not much given to great thought. They live in families, which are often convoluted, in-bred affairs, and mutation is common- in fact, some scholars believe Ogres may be human in nature, but wholly transformed through some unknown mechanism. Some ogres raise pigs, bears, and other animals for meat, milk, and hides, and may even peacefully trade with humans. Most ogres, though, allow hunger to rule their lives, and are hard pressed to decide whether to greet a human or merely eat them. Some ogres are able to wield magic, and these beings are greatly feared.

Far more wicked than Ogres are Trolls. These beings usually live alone, often under bridges or near water. Most are gray or green skinned, often having long arms, tails, massive teeth, humps, or any of a dozen other foul features. Trolls, more often than not, cannot speak, and instead exist in states of joyful slaughter, moving from creature to creature, reveling in the pain they can cause. Some few, with low cunning, are hired as mercenaries by the truly wicked or desperate.

Some scholars believe every once in a while, a goblin of great malice will undergo a change, possibly a form of Chaos mutation. These wretches become Orcs, losing much of their mind in exchange for brutal power. Others point to Ogre families who dwell near humans, and blame orcs on the wicked by-blows of their commerce. Still others think, quite oddly, that orcs can be bred in huge vats out of meat, wood, and cast off magic. There are few who know the truth, if there is but one truth to be had.

Lastly, there is some evidence that these four types of humanoids collectively worship a "god" of sorts, the Moon made manifest, for much of their art depicts full and crescent moons and they are most active at night. If this god has a name, or is able to grant powers to its followers in the way the Three are, such information is largely unknown.

## Near-Humans - Duergar, Elvenkind, and Shapeshifters
There are beings in Europa who are not dissimilar to humans, but who have their own cultures, technologies, traditions, and the like. The most common of these are Shapeshifters such as seablooded, werewolves, werebears, and the like. These creatures normally live in small camps in the wilderness, spending time in the shape of both man and beast as suits them. Shapeshifters were driven to the outskirts of society by the Romans, and are little trusted due to the perception of crude manners and violence.

Duergar, on the other hand, are often welcome in human society, though they tend to dwell in their own villages and mines. These so-called “Mountain People” or “Dwarves” are master smiths, miners, and warriors, who keep their own counsel, and live, work, and worship in their own quiet way. The Duergar do little to meddle in the affairs of humanity, though they can be ferocious enemies when their rage is risen.

Lastly, long ago in Europa there was a race of human-like beings who were masters of magic and civilization. Said to be kin to Fae and mortal alike, the majority of the Elves died out, or disappeared, before even the time of Rome. Though rare interactions with beings who seem to act and appear as Elves, and even call themselves such, do still occur, it is assumed that most modern “Elves” are the mostly-human descendants of such beings, or of Fae-mortal liaisons.

Near-Animals- Chimera, Dire Animals, Great Rats, and White Beasts
There are many types of nearly natural animals that dwell in Europa. The most common are Dire Animals, which are sometimes mistaken for Beastmen. They are larger, more humanoid, more aggressive versions of natural creatures. These are understood to be free from the taint of Chaos. Boar, bear, and deer are all common dire beasts. Dire Animals are distinct from ordinary creatures in that they are played by NPCs. Unlike beastmen, they are edible. They are prized as game, and some are illegal to hunt without the permission of a noble, though it is generally allowed to kill them in self-defense.

Chimera are strange beasts possessing the traits of two or more animals. Many of the famous creatures of antiquity- griffins, manticores, pegasi, and the like- were chimeric in nature. It is believed that many are the results of Chaotic influence, for the armies of Teutonia and the Danes sometimes make use of chimeric creatures, even sometimes creating Beastmen of them.

Whether Chaos is a part of their ancestry or not, chimera tend to be quick tempered and capable of great violence, and are best left alone in the hidden places where they dwell.

Great Rats are bipedal, speaking creatures who may be the descendants of beastmen or dire beasts, or something unique to themselves. They often mimic portions of human society, with amusing or dangerous results. Thieves and scavengers, most places in Europa count them as vermin, and pay well to have them eradicated.

Lastly, White Beasts are generally typical representations of their animal or dire animal species, but are possessed of intelligence and wisdom far surpassing others of their kind. They are said to be sacred to the Lord of the Wild, and the hunting or harming of them is forbidden in many lands, despite the valuable magical properties their flesh and blood are rumored to possess.

## Undead
Lastly, there are the Undead. While most dead sleep, and dream of the promised future of the gods, a spirit might be awakened from its rest, sometimes due to its own pain, suffering and unfinished business, but more often through the foul magics of necromancy. With or without their bodies, they walk among the living in many forms- zombies, skeletons, haunts, wights, revenants, ghouls, and more. The source of necromancy is the greatest of the Undead- Vampires. True Vampires have betrayed the three gods and have been damned for it. They are able to create other, lesser vampires, who in turn can do the same, until thin vampire blood flows through the veins of many mortals.

## Ghosts
Not truly undead, echoes of the memory of mortals who left unfinished business sometimes can be found lingering in the real world as spirits or ghosts. These pitiful beings often seek out the living, either to take out half-remembered frustrations, or for assistance in releasing them from the pattern of their pain.

# TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE

## Technology in Europa
Most of Europa’s general level of advancement is at the equivalent to our real world 13th to 14th century. Roman numerals have given way to the Arabic, and the concept of zero is well known. Cities have knowledge of cranes, water hammers, hourglasses, and there are even mechanical clocks, the province of the rich.

There are windmills, compasses, and glass windows, and spectacles are common. Plate and chain armor is relatively common, and relatively cheap, though full plate armor of the “Gothic” or “Milanese” variety is very rare, being technically newer than the time period Mystwood emulates most closely. Crossbows are not uncommon, and firearms, though recently invented, are becoming more common. There are a few rare printing presses, but movable type is not common.

Generally speaking, Mystwood would prefer that you make use of primitive or less obvious options where they are available- knives instead of scissors, contact lenses instead of modern glasses, etc.- but the conveniences of modern life are hard to entirely eschew, and Mystwood recognizes this.

## Medicine and The Four Humors
The germ theory of disease- that diseases are caused by microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses- is not true and has largely been discredited in Mystwood, one of the many ways the game world is different from ours. Dirty hands do not necessarily cause more illness, and so filthy aprons, a lack of gloves, etc. are common for barber surgeons and other healers.

In the Mystwood, the ancient theory of humorism is the dominant medical paradigm, and is related to a number of mechanics. This theory, while long ago discredited in our real world, is true in our game world, and can have a number of effects and results.

In humorism, the human body has four basic substances, called humors, which are in balance (or nearly so) when a person is healthy, and are imbalanced or absent when they are not.

Afflictions may be caused by absence, overabundance or corruption of humors, and a person's basic personality is also related to one of the four humors, especially for characters with the Gift of Passion. Diet, exercise, environment, and a number of other factors can also contribute to increasing or decreasing the levels of the humors, in a complicated and sometimes contradictory manner that is outside the scope of game mechanics.

The four humors and the inclusion of humorism help characters diagnose and treat the things which are afflicting their friends and companions. An individual character may role play their personality however they like, regardless of whether or not they have the Gift of Passion or whether they have an affliction based on a humor, unless that affliction states a personality change.

The four humors are described below.

## Blood (Sanguine)
An overabundance or affinity to Blood, produced by the liver, causes a person's personality to become sanguine. Such people are often extroverted, enthusiastic, active and charismatic. Blood is associated with the element of Air and the season of spring. It is considered to be "warm" and "wet" for purposes of correspondences. Too much blood might result in inflammation, feebleness and lassitude, or parasitic infection. The primary associated cure related to blood (for the skill Cure Affliction) is Bloodletting.

## Yellow Bile (Choleric)
Yellow Bile, produced by the gallbladder, causes a person to be choleric. They tend to be decisive, goal oriented, enjoy being in charge and are considered logical. Yellow bile is associated with the element of Fire and the season of summer. It is "warm" and "dry". Too much yellow bile can result in fever, aggression, and issues with the joints. The associated cure is Sweating.

## Black Bile (Melancholic)
Black bile, produced by the spleen, causes one to be melancholic. Such folk tend to be analytical, deep thinkers, and introverted. They are often anxious and self-reliant, striving for perfection. Black bile and melancholy is associated with the element of Earth and the season of autumn. Black bile is "cold" and "dry", and overabundance can result in depression, insomnia, and mental weakness. The associated cure is Activity.

## Phlegm (Phlegmatic)
Phlegm, produced by the brain and lungs, results in a phlegmatic personality, being relaxed, peaceful, and easy-going. They tend to compromise and hide emotions. Phlegm is associated with Water and winter, and is "cold" and "wet". Overabundance can result in nausea, and pain. The associated cure is Warming.

## Possession
Some Afflictions of the humors have little to do with the action or inaction of a person, and are instead the result of external forces, such as daemons or bodiless spirits infesting and altering the body. Such afflictions tend to be harder to cure and have more unpleasant effects. The Great Plague, for example, is often associated with Chaos, Leprosy with Undeath, and Madness with the Fae. These afflictions of Possession must often be treated with Exorcism, requiring both medical treatment and spiritual.

For more information on the mechanics of Afflictions, see page XX.

## Common Afflictions
The following Afflictions can be found at every Mystwood Chapter, and are “built in” to the game due to various mechanics and rules requiring them. Your character has certainly encountered people suffering from one or all of these Afflictions in their lifetime.

### Blood Bond
Caused by the sharing of tainted blood with another, generally for the purposes of healing. Blood Bond creates an increasingly powerful link between two creatures, which ultimately results in unsettling personality changes for the receiver of the blood.

### Branding
Used as a punishment by many legal jurisdictions, brandings are usually on the face or hands, often a letter or symbol denoting the crime. Such brands cause social ostracism, but the lasting pain also has negative effects on the branded person. On the other hand, some criminal organizations recognize such marks as a badge of honor.

### Mark of Chaos
Typically appearing as a rune or symbol on the skin, often with an accompanying effect on the personality, Marks of Chaos are almost always obtained when a mortal makes a bargain with a being or object that is Chaotic in nature.

### Tainted Wound
Representing festering wounds caused by errors or misjudgment during medical procedures, or damage from befouled weapons, tainted wounds manifest in a variety of ways from the annoying and short term to the deadly and nearly permanent.

### Swamp Fleas
Vile parasites found the world over in swamps, dungeons, and on locals with poor hygiene, swamp fleas are contagious, annoying, and the cause of many structure fires as fed-up magistrates attempt to burn the pestilence out.

### Swift Rot
Decay of the body and soul caused by contamination with Undead blood or flesh, swift rot causes a person to sicken, die, and return as one of the undead in quick succession, often mere hours.

# RELIGION

## INTRODUCTION
Long ago, mankind worshiped many gods, under hundreds of names. The men and women of Hellas worshiped a pantheon headed by mighty Zeus, while to their south the Aegyptians worshiped many gods, some with animal traits. In what is now the modern League and Scandia, man and beastman alike venerated Fae, or the grim gods of the Aesir. The Romans adopted all the gods they encountered, assimilating them into the personages of their deities (who in turn were inspired by the Hellans). And, hidden throughout all these faiths, the insidious cults of Chaos masqueraded as deities- or merely practiced their debauched rites in the open, with few goodly folk to oppose them.

All this changed when a group of priests from many faiths, dissatisfied with the constant bickering and warfare amongst their followers, convened a council. At this council, the followers of many gods discussed the tenets, rites, and beliefs that their faiths shared. They observed amongst themselves the rites which had power, and discarded those that seemed to be only idle ceremony, with no true holiness. Much argument and turmoil gave way, over the course of three years, to a divine understanding. From the many different viewpoints, the Council of Faith determined a central truth, from which a new, unified Church would arise. The end of the Council would mark the first year of a new era, the beginning of the modern calendar- Year One, After Unification. And so, throughout the Empire that was Rome and beyond, spread by priest and messenger, the Church took hold, driving the faiths of Fae and Chaos to the very borders of Europa.

Today, the Church teaches that there are three gods, and that it is blasphemy to try to name them. Instead, the gods are given titles- Justice, Mercy, and Wild. The gods love the world, and all mortalkind, even those who are wicked or tainted by Chaos. This can be seen in the miraculous powers that those who follow the tenets of the gods are capable of- so called “Karmic Powers”.

However, the gods do not speak as mortals do, nor do they appear in any form, though some hold that they send dreams. Only priests and priestesses, properly sanctified and trained, can serve as intermediaries between mortal and god, allowing the gods to hear the prayers of mortals, and mortals to earn a fraction of the power of the gods. Each priest (and, indeed each congregant) must interpret the writings of the saints and the teachings of wise folk in their own ways. What can be agreed upon, however, are the seven tenets of Faith, established at the Council of Faiths.

### The First Tenet
There are three gods, each alike and equal in Benevolence and Necessity.

### The Second Tenet
Each person of True Faith is called to serve a single deity, to the exclusion of the others.

### The Third Tenet
The gods that came before were named and given traits, which caused division and strife. Truly, the Gods of Man are without name or form. It is the unclean “gods” of Chaos who are given blasphemous names by their wretched followers. These shall not be uttered.

### The Fourth Tenet
The Gods embody and inspire what is pure and good in humankind- honor, order, compassion, humility, justice, wisdom, courage, and respect for nature. The so-called “gods of Chaos” embody all that is foul, and that humankind must overcome- greed, envy, fear, madness, sadism, lust, and rage.

### The Fifth Tenet
Though the world was born of Chaos, as the plan of the gods unfolds, it becomes pure. So too must mortalkind strive to overcome the evil within them, and reach their potential. Alas, the evil of Chaos- base emotions, cruelty, and disorder- unmakes the world and separates mortals from the gods. One must struggle against such things, both in the exterior world and within oneself.

### The Sixth Tenet
In time, all mortals must die, and in dying, sleep in the grave until the world is made pure of all evil and Chaos, when the gods will awaken them. There is but one exception to this, and that is Sainthood. While echoes of the dead might linger due to unfinished business, or flesh be returned through the blasphemy of Undeath, these are to be pitied, and freed from their miserable existence.

### The Seventh Tenet
Those who have lived extraordinary lives may, upon dying, be returned for a single day. Through these Saints, the gods reveal their will, for each Saint is returned with true inspiration, given by the gods, as to the divine plan for creation. It is through the words of Saints that we come to know the natures and plans of the gods, and how to separate what is Holy from what is base, or worse, what is of Chaos. Alas, the Saints are but mortal, and so their divine revelations may be delivered poorly, or misinterpreted by those who record their teachings. The Apocrypha of the Saints often contradict one another, and it is only by pondering the lives and words of many saints that one truly comes to know the gods.

## Duties and Sins
No living being is perfect in the eyes of the gods. With that said, there are certain actions which are particularly pleasing, and others in turn displeasing, to each of the three gods. When a follower of one of the gods performs deeds which the gods deem favorable, they may earn Karma. When a follower sins against the tenets of their god, they must atone.

Every deity has particular sins. If you commit a sin (and no one is perfect all the time), you may continue to earn, but may not use, Karma until you have completed a penance assigned by a priest. You must pay close attention to the sins of your deity. It is your responsibility to know if you have sinned, and if you desire to make use of Karma again, your responsibility to seek out a priest and perform absolution.

## Ritual and Absolution
The substance of rituals, penances and so on vary a great deal. It is important that any ritual you perform be in good taste, and further important that the ritual not draw directly or completely from any real world religion or mythology. It is acceptable to change a real world function in nature and wording so that the result is similar in tone, but an in-game ritual should never make a player feel uncomfortable that a real world religious rite is being performed, or worse, mocked.

Common rituals include shared songs, stories of the works of the Saints (which may be made up on the fly or may be found in-game in books or scrolls), examples of places the teachings of the gods caused you to make certain decisions in-game, sermons about duties or sins, and the like. They may be as complex or as simple as the practicing character desires, though Justice rituals tend to be more complicated, and Mercy the simplest.

Penance or absolution of sin is equally varied. Common penances include the Tithe, whereby some measure of the character’s wealth is consigned to the Church, the Serviciam, where the sinner agrees to obey some worthy person the priest points out for a period of time, and the Gauntlet, a swift and sound beating administered by the priest or a proxy. Particularly egregious sins, such as the raising of Undead by a follower of the Wild, may be considered nearly unforgiveable- such actions may require that the character embrace the life of a penitent (and accepting that Occupation) for a period of time (such as a year) in order to regain the good graces of their faith.

Penance for ordained priests, monks, and other church members is generally more complicated, painful, public, and consequently humiliating in the eyes of society. It almost always involves a period of time as a Penitent, and may be considerably more elaborate.

If you are a player character who is able to perform Absolution, Divine Ceremony, or other religious rites, please feel free to communicate with existing players, staff, and the Game Masters if you have any questions about how to role play these activities.

## Saintly Revelation
Due to the nature of Saintly Revelation, there is a fair amount of variation in the actual practice of worshiping the gods. It is therefore perfectly allowable to make up your own ceremonies and such, as long as they are in good taste. You may also choose to change or omit a total of two Sins, Rituals, or Duties from those listed for your god, to reflect your particular beliefs. Once you have chosen a deity, and modified their duties and sins, you may not change again unless something extraordinary happens in your character’s life. This must be approved by the Staff.

## Depictions of the Three Gods
Often, but not always, Justice is portrayed as an older male, Mercy as a younger female, and the Wild as either androgynous, having traits of all genders, or as an animal such as a stag. However, it is not heresy or sin to depict any of the three gods as whatever gender, or lack thereof, you prefer. Some hardliners of the Church say any depiction of the Three is as anathema as naming them, but they are in a (vocal) minority.

## Justice, Wisdom, the Keeper of the Scales
It is through the inspiration of Justice that mortals build ordered societies, and so prosper. With each person playing their part, the whole is greater than the sum of those parts. It is through Wisdom that knowledge is gained and preserved. It is the Keeper of the Scales that sees that evil is punished, that all are held to account, and that the law is honored as it must be. They are a stern, but never needlessly cruel god, a benevolent monarch. It is through their inspiration that mortal laws, governments, and societies become more perfect over time. Justice has progressed from the anarchy of the ancient past, through the cruel despotism of empires, to the current enlightened age when honors can be earned by the worthy, serfs may purchase their freedom, and even the nobility must respect the law. In time, it is said, justice and the rights of all will advance even further with his guidance, though it is hard to imagine what form this might take.

Followers of Justice strive particularly for the destruction of all things Chaotic, especially Daemons.

## Mercy, Courage, Fortune, the Maiden, Brave Sister, the Iron Dove
There is no greater gift than the ability to feel- to love, to laugh, to strive, to hope, and to forgive. Mercy bestows this gift, and it is they that makes life worth living. Mercy is a deity of both love and battle. Mercy represents the bonds between humankind that transcend the laws of society and the harsh realities of nature. Mercy is true courage on the field- the fight to protect loved ones beside worthy companions, and to stop the enemy quickly, and without hardship. Mercy engenders love of freedom, and of family. They are the bulwark against the greatest threats of Chaos- cruelty, anger, greed, and the dark forces that corrupt one’s spirit.

Mercy recognizes that there is good in even the darkest hearts, and that all may hope and strive for forgiveness. They are the light in darkest times, the bringer of hope.

Followers of Mercy believe in the importance of courage and being true to one’s own heart above all else. They will never flee the field of battle or leave others behind, and while they will fight fiercely when needed, they strive for peace when they can.

## The Wild, Nature, the Huntsman, the Keeper of the Dead, the Lord of Gold
The Wild is the god of all things Primal- the needs of the body, the natural cycles of procreation, life, consumption, and death, and the results of these cycles. It is the link between humankind and the world around them that must never be severed. It is the kinship between human and animal, the primal spirit that enables humans to survive, compete, and prosper. The Wild represents not just the harvest and the hunt, but also the honest labor and skillful craft of the common folk, and their efforts to win coin. The dead are in its keeping, and also the riches of the earth. The Wild teaches the need to both preserve and prosper from the natural world. It is the dictum that, sometimes, the weak must perish, so that the strong may survive.

It is the Wild.

Followers of the Wild have a great hatred for the Undead, for they break the circle of life, and steal what was in the keeping of the Wild.

## Other Faiths in Europa

### Heresy
The Church is vast, but not hegemonic- there still exists great room for interpretation. As mentioned above under Saintly Revelation, individuals may have a different point of view on the tenets of faith, and have slightly differing duties and sins. However, these minor modifications are a slippery slope towards true heresy.

True Heresy in Mystwood is represented by such examples as Monotheism, where a character believes only one of the three is a true god worthy of worship (often Mercy), or the Harrow Cult, who believed that there are five gods, dividing the powers and sins of the Three differently and adding Chaos and Undeath into the mix as well. Perhaps the most common Heresy is the concept that all three of the gods can be actively worshiped at once, their sins and powers made available to all. Some evidence suggests that the gods do sometimes continue to reward individuals who hold heretical practices, but the mortal Church actively roots out heretics it discovers with fire and the sword.

Characters may come to be heretics in the course of play, or the second character a player makes at a given chapter may begin with such beliefs. Such characters will follow the mechanics for one of the Three as given above unless otherwise instructed by a Game Master.

### Tripartitism
The Church of the Three is confined largely to Europa. However, there are other followers of the Three, in Araby, Thule, and Khemt, and such followers belong to a parallel sect known as the Tripartites. Considered heretics by the Church, the major difference in doctrine between the Church and the Tripartites is that the Church believes the three gods to be entirely separate beings, while Tripartites believe the three gods to be three independent aspects of a single whole. Such philosophical differences are of critical import to theologians and dogmatics, but ultimately a peasant harvesting barley in Kvenland and a fisherman in the Arabian Gulf will not see much difference in their faiths.

The second player character a player makes at a given Chapter may choose to be a Tripartite, if they are from the appropriate cultural background- for example, from Araby or Thule. The mechanics for Tripartite worship are identical to worshiping the Three.

### Old Gods
In the world of Mystwood, there remain pockets and isolated cults who continue to follow ancestral faiths from prior to the Unification of the Three nearly a thousand years ago. As mentioned above, the Old Gods, worshiped by the Celts, Germans, Greeks, Norse, Romans and many others, may embody aspects of the Three, or may be creatures of Chaos, the Fae, or Undeath. No mortal knows, and even these gods do not speak to their followers. Who can say if, for example, One-Eye, head of the Skandian pantheon, is Justice in an older guise, or a great being of Chaos, or something else entirely? Further, worship of the old gods (in-game) is often a criminal activity, and in many parts of Europa heathen faiths are subject to violence and discrimination.

The second player character a player makes at a given Chapter may choose to worship the Old Gods of their culture, if they are from the appropriate background- for example, a Skandian from Kvenland. Some places may have shrines to these Old Gods, but if these are truly responses from the Old Gods or merely Matrix-like magical effects is a matter of interpretation. If the Old Gods truly offer rewards on the order of Karmic Powers, they have been silent for centuries. Many more pragmatic or syncretic followers of the Old Gods merely call Mercy, Justice, or the Wild by ancient names when in private, paying lip service to ancient ceremonies while observing Church sins and duties. If this practice angers the gods, they rarely react.

### Chaos
Always seductive, existing on the edges of society, Chaos cults permeate all nations and cultures of Europa. Some cults purport to be brotherhoods devoted to the powers of magic, or mere philosophers, or warrior kinships. Others declare themselves openly, though these tend to be destroyed quickly. Service to Chaos typically results in lives that are nasty, brutish, and short. Great power can be received, at the cost of one’s life and sanity.

### Elemental Lords
Like the cults of Chaos, the other Elements- Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and even Death, Life, and Time- have mighty beings who are able to bestow a variety of benefits to mortals who swear themselves to service. The Elemental Lords are not gods, though, and do not grant miracles. Instead, choosing to serve the Elemental Lords generally entails doing them favors and services in exchange for bestowed powers and elemental Components.

### The Cult of the Moon God
Rumors tell that some nonhuman mortals- goblins, orcs, ogres and the like- serve a Moon God. Humans are rarely privy to the strange rituals of these nonhuman folk, which seem to differ from place to place and tribe to tribe. The few tenets agreed upon by most goblins are survival of the self and tribe, opposition to Chaos, and the importance of tradition.

### The Fae
Some of the mighty Fae Lords and Ladies accept mortal servants, usually for their own amusement. It is claimed by some that mortals can become Fae, and Fae mortal, by forswearing certain aspects of their nature, but the process of this is unknown.
