# Mystwood Chapter: The Keep  

Home to an assortment of tradespeople, travelers and otherwise spirited free people of the realm, the Mystwood
Keep was resettled in the name of Duke Guilford II before his passing. It now stands as testament to its founder and
of its peoples endurance, a free-town for enterprising adventurers.
Most inhabitants of Mystwood know that they dwell in the Duchy of Eastmarch, and that Eastmarch is part of the
larger Kingdom of Navarre. But Navarre, like most lands in the Known World, is a weak and fragmented land, and
the Duchess Genevieve of Eastmarch is the greatest power most will ever know. It is the local barons and knights,
who hold lands throughout the duchy and within the Mystwood that represent the power of Eastmarch, and deal with
her matters directly. Most folk could not tell you the King’s name, or that Navarre has long been at war with Albion,
or the reasons for that war. The enemies of Eastmarch are many and better known- the cruel Norse of Skandia, Chaos
in its many forms including the Marauders of Teutonia and Thule, the Goblins of the mountains to the south who
have remained quiet for too long, and above all the Dragon.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MYSTWOOD KEEP
Local legend tells that the Mystwood was once the edge of the great Empire now embodied in Byzantium, the City of
Wonders. Brave Imperial soldiers drove back the Beastmen and other denizens of the forest and built roads, walls,
forts and towns. The greatest of these was the city of Aquila, which long stood as bulwark against monsters and
barbarian hordes as the Empire collapsed, besieged from without and gnawed from within by the insidious forces of
Chaos.

Alas, Aquila fell, so the stories say, when the last Emperor, whom some name Romulous and some call Augustus, fled
there with a great horde of treasure. The power of Chaos corrupted him through his greed and fear, and he was
transformed into the great Dragon that plagues the land to this day. Brave Aquila and her legion perished in flame,
and to this day her ruins, fused to blackened glass, still rise among the trees of Mystwood.
Living memory extends back only about seventy years. Around 910, hordes of Chaos swept through the League to
Eastmarch, pillaging and burning. The baronies that are now the Mystwood were all but deserted, and the border
barons moved further west, abandoning their holdings and castles to the wood. As uninhabited land, the Mystwood
fell under the direct control of the dutchy of Eastmarch. Dukes past and present doubtless wished to profit from their
new acquisition, but for many years it remained a lawless wilderness.
All that changed with the coming of Saint Siventus, a questing Knight. In 950, visions led him to a hidden chamber
within the ruins of Aquila, and there he found a treasure greater than gold- tomes from the Library of Alexapolis, a
center of learning in distant Aegyptus founded by Alexa the Great, the most powerful conqueror the world has ever
known. Among those tomes was the Book of Life, a blessed volume that would preserve all those who wrote their
name within it from violence and misfortune.
Alas, its protection was not sufficient to save Siventus when he took up arms against the Dragon, and the brave
knight perished and ascended to sainthood. St. Siventus had wounded the Dragon sorely, however. Though it has not
been seen in the sky for years, the folk of Mystwood take no chances against the dragon, keeping their green roofed
homes well hidden beneath the trees.

With the Dragon absent, folk were drawn to the riches found within the ruins that abound in the Mystwood, and they
cleared land to build their homes. Yet those homes and fields fell vacant, for in 960 a deadly plague swept through
Navarre and into the Mystwood, where it lay low nine out of ten inhabitants.
In 961, Duke Guilford II began to offer coin to those brave and learned enough to write their names in the Book of
Life and resettle the Mystwood, and in 964 he extended this offer to those willing to settle in his newly acquired
holding of Burgundar.

This expansion and the riches found within the ruins throughout the Mystwood, as well as the Duke’s declining health
drew forth those who would seek to claim the duchy. When in late 967 Duke Guilford II passed away, claimants or
nominations for the ducal seat were made by right and resource of the baronies, save one, Dragonshire which
remained a neutral party in the ducal affairs. These claims caused unrest among the lands, and in the year 968
allegiances sparked a great civil war, distracting Eastmarch from her affairs with Albion and the forces of Chaos as
they grew in power.

As Eastmarch rebuilt and reorganized in 968, the Mystwood Keep was granted its own charter to be recognized as a
free-town beholden to the duchy but with its own jurisdiction and oversight of daily affairs. Most notable among its
laws are that the town shall be governed by a lord-mayor and that the town guard is to be raised and supported by the
Keep elected officials and residents. The protection of the ruins of Aquila, and it’s artifacts fall within this jurisdiction.
Matters beyond the sight of the Keep, beyond the gully and nearby swamps that house the Aquilan ruins, fall to the
ducal guard, who reserve the right to call upon the Keep guard and her people to protect the duchy.

## THE LANDS OF THE MYSTWOOD AND BEYOND
Its geography is lesser known then the History of the Mystwood to the common free citizens of the Eastmarch.
Navarre covers a great amount of territory, bordered by North Sea and isolated by the mountains to the south of
Pelancia through the Marches and west into the League. The courts and lords of Navarre have had little regard for a
wooded and hilly land-gift beyond the civilized lands but for the brave adventurers and rugged Navarrean’s that have
uncovered its wealth of resources and now call the Mystwood home. Few within the Mystwood will ever see a ship.
Even horses are a rare sight due to the rugged terrain. The Mystwood once an overgrown unclaimed territory gifted to
the duke of Eastmarch still remains largely unexplored with dense forests, mountainous peaks and ancient ruins to
break the horizon.

Four baronies and the holding of the Mystwood comprise the duchy of Eastmarch. Three of these baronies border
the Mystwood and provide the bulk of the settlers, and form a bulwark for Navarre against external threats. A fourth
barony, Eastmarch proper, is home to the capitol and Ducal seat from which it takes its name. Starting player
characters for the Chronicles of the Keep must choose from any of these baronies or the holding of the Mystwood as
their background homeland. The inhabitants of the Mystwood are subjects of the Duchess of Eastmarch, though
many will likely have been born in the lands of one of the three lesser baronies and may answer to the lords and ladies
of their homelands as well.

### Dragonshire
To the west of Mystwood, is the largest, most powerful of the three closer baronies. It is also the most likely to
meddle in the affairs of the Mystwood once laying claim to the lands. Most of it is poor land, much devastated by the
Dragon, but the hard work of its people has made Dragonshire prosperous nonetheless. Dragonshire's colors are
Black and Yellow. Its castle, Dracford, is a grand seat for the Baron Andrac alongside the river Elwash, on the
boundary of the Mystwood, a land his ancestors were unsuccessful in settling.
Much of Dragonshire's land has grown up with forest,
and is only recently being cleared. Some of its villages,
like Aurewood and Bymaple Pond, are quite idyllic,
with prosperous but hard working inhabitants. Other
settlements, such as Fallowdale and Muckle Down, are
smaller and meaner, inhabited by the most wretched
of serfs. Silverpoint, the only bridge along the East
Road into Mystwood, is a popular stopping point,
though the heavy toll levied to cross sometimes leads
travelers to make great detours.

To take the Dragon as a symbol of one's house is a
sign of arrogance in the eyes of many, and Baron
Andrac is well suited to it. The baron was a minor
scion of the family, who rose to power through merit
during the power vacuum following the death of the
previous Baron. He is known for unusual ideas on
religion. The Baron has been said to have made formal
proposal to the Duchess but this is not spoken in
public circles for fear of it being a rumor.
Although it is not in Dragonshire proper, the Abbey
of St. Siventus should also be mentioned. A mighty
fortress restored by Baron Andrac and the former
baronial capital of Cairnwood before that baron
retreated back into the safer lands of the west. The
Abbey serves Eastmarch guarding the road from the
Mystwood to the league and the southward highway
that links Eastmarch with the city of Venetia and the
lands of Carpathia. The armies of Unlife have assailed
it many times in recent years, but it has never fallen,
defended as it is by stalwart warrior monks of the cult
of Justice. A safe harbor from chaos along the road.

### Fenwyck
Northernmost, is a land of dreary fens and moors, bordering the sea. Much threatened by raiders, its people are hardy,
independent, and superstitious. Its ruler, Baron Rife, is young in age but old in spirit as was his sister Orla who ruled
before him. Still feared as a potent knight and a firm ruler, Baron Rife has worked to undue countless damages made
with the people of Fenwyck and their neighbors through the ducal succession wars. He maintains his seat in the
ancient fortress of Caer Aldwyn, but has traveled the lands with members of his court to reassure his people and seek
justice for those felled unfairly in the battles. Fenwyck's colors are Green and Grey.
Scattered along the edges of its northern marshes, many of the people of Fenwyck live in the simplest of dwellings,
built of turf or stone, and following ways of life unchanged for thousands of years- fishing, tending sheep, and waging
war, each in their season. The northernmost outpost of Fenwyck is the village of Colwaith. Ships from the North Sea
call there, and the blood of Skandia runs in the veins of many of the inhabitants.
Inland along the shores of Lake Soloy is Dawnwater's Edge, a village built entirely on stilts for protection from the
Skandian raiders. This land draws travelers with interest in its natural beauty and rich adventure.

### Pelancia
To the west of the March lies the Barony of Pelancia. It has a mild
climate and rich agricultural land with much trade coming up the river
Lucerin. It is ruled by the masked Baron Baldwin Rochvall, a kind yet
secretive lord, and its colors are brown and blue.
The Rochvall seat of Tiras Ethanor lies nestled between the Grey
Mountains and the edge of the Mystwood forest. Said to have been
built by the Fae, Tiras Ethanor is one of the great wonders of
Navarre, it’s towers seeming too tall and graceful to have been built
without magic. Indeed, Fae blood is known to run in the veins of
many who call Pelancia home. It’s court home to the glamoured.
From Tiras Ethanor the River Lucerin flows to the village of Driftford or Driftfield, whose inhabitants are mostly
concerned with the floating of logs down river, the raising of sheep, and arguing over whether the proper name of the
village is Driftford or Driftfield. Further west lies Summermill, the summer home of the Rochvall line, and Shandlin’s
Ferry which prospers from trade with Burgundy the south.
When the March of Luceval was founded, Pelancia lost the County of Elwash from its own holdings, which many
consider a punishment from the Duchess for Baron Baldwin’s lack of direct support in the Civil War.

### Eastmarch (The Ducal Lands)
To the west, beyond Dragonshire, is the baronial lands held directly by the Duchess, Genevieve. In her seat, newly
won through war and compromise, she is much concerned with the affairs of the larger kingdom and her people.
Having been involved in the daily operations of Eastmarch (both barony and duchy) prior to her uncle Duke Gulford
II’s death, Genevieve is well prepared to oversee the complex economic and political workings of the capital. The only
true cities of Eastmarch, Trieste, the capital, (pronounced Tree-Est) and Tweaksbury (boasting several paved streets)
are found in the duke's lands. The Duke's colors are Black and White. In Trieste is to be found the great Cathedral of
St. Amelia, recently finished and considered a great wonder. Another cathedral remains un-finished in Tweaksbury,
but the funds for its completion have started to flow to the church. Tweaksbury has grown a great deal in recent years,
and is now rather too large for its walls.
Rich farmlands surround the two main cities, with populations much greater than those of the baronies, and a number
of lesser villages. The Ducal lands are the center of Guild activity, both legitimate and otherwise.
Though the heartlands of Eastmarch are shielded from the perils of the Mystwood and the forces of Chaos beyond it,
they have recently been ravaged by the forces of Albion. Albion's Queen Elspeth claims lordship over all Navarre, and
many of the lords along the coast have sworn allegiance to her. Past Dukes have been able to avoid war for many
years through skillful diplomacy, but now each summer brings skirmishes along the coast as bands of Albionese
soldiers raid inland, sometimes reaching as far inland as Tweaksbury. In 957, even the ducal seat at Trieste was
besieged. The power imbalance of 968 has left the seacoast victim to easy passing of Albanese spies and bandits.

## The Villages and Keep of Mystwood
The lands within the Mystwood are a loose collection of villages, farmsteads and land grants held by nobles and
knights. There are several places of importance that have recently been reclaimed and still others that remain on the
edges of untamed wilderness and lawless lands. The Keep is the central location within Mystwood. Its boundaries
strengthened through the efforts of Duke Guilford II and the many people that have relocated to the Mystwood from
around Navarre at his call over the 10 years past. Now a prosperous free-town, the Keep is a center of trade, a respite
from battles with chaos and home to an enchanted library. This library, once founded in the ancient city of Aquila,
holds many tomes spanning the histories of the surrounding lands, great scrolls on the nature of magic and blessed
artifacts such as the Three Books of Power- the Book of Life, the Book of Heroes, and the Book of Woe. The
primary entrance to the ruined city of Aquila also falls nearby the walls, and is under the protection of the Keep.
The Keep is immediately bordered by Low Town, a shanty village of laborers, cast offs and pilgrims whose busy work
and steady determination have allowed the Keep finding its prosperity in the darkest part of the wood. They are
people of craft and cunning instinct. It is said that the people of Low Town managed to find their own prosperity
alongside the Keep as they are quick to adapt from illegal brewing activities to endorsement as the sole legal brew
suppliers for the local town tavern and for the Lord-Mayor’s house of the Keep.
Beyond the gatehouse and gullies of the Keep are rolling hills and fields that make the bulk of the inhabited
Mystwood, a land still held by the ducal court. From the stonewalled cattle fields of Notchwood, with its small estates
and jealously protected history, clouded but not forgotten. To the superstitious aldermen engaged in the political
activities of Eastwall, a mountainside village shadowed by chaos and a secreted town governance. Travel over the
mountain top and beyond the rocky crag where you will find several homes of the local nobles and notables, namely a
stately manor and lands once owned by the Belsom family, resettled as a home to Sir Ibbyoui of House Militaris,
Knight of the Realm and his retinue. Bordered by densely wooded forests that hold tight the paths to the secrets of
the Mystwood including the gentle monks of Rosehaven who spend their days brewing wine and pondering the
philosophies of the gods and man. They are said to be welcoming to visitors, if the traveler can find their doorstep.
They offer wine, good words and trade in salt for those interested.

### The Waystones
Off many of the forested paths of the Mystwood, you will find secret places and ways protected by the fae through
ancient elven magics. A shrine worshipped by the lizard-kin, a colony of the diseased, a hive of large, ever skirmishing
rats, a den of thieves that gamble away the daylight and set traps fit for a true rogue, dark spider infested woods and
the veiled path to the Rosehaven Abby. Many of the waystones are known but each must be found anew as the
secrets of the waystones have been affected by the forces of Chaos and thus may change without warning. Following
the unrest of the civil war upon the Mystwood, and the subsequent rise of the Chaos Knight known as Sir Baldric,
waystones began to behave unusually. Chaos has shown an interest in the magic of the ways and these protected paths
have been rumored to have changed location, affected those who sleep with illness and may even be changing the
very forest around their threshold.

### The Guard Tower
The Ducal Guard, garbed in the black and white livery of the duchy, watch over all
of the Mystwood from their outpost atop a prominent hill near the crossroads. All
matters of concern within the Mystwood fall under their purview in service to the
duke or duchess. That is all matters save those of the free-town of the Keep and
the Lord-Mayor’s guard who answer directly to the duchy through the guard but
are tasked with managing the affairs of the keep and the land within sight from its
walls. The ducal guard often travel to and from the Keep on the business of the
duchy and often have work and tasks for those so equipped.
